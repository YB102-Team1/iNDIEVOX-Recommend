But the real standouts on this collection are the two tunes by Flip Anderson and Kenny Beard. Bob Wills could have done the opening title track, as it walks the Western swing fence in a straight line with some killer pedal steel work. Add to this Anderson''s co-write with J.D. Loudermilk, called "Cold Beer," a swaggering honky tonk number with righteous fiddle work, and you have a pair of oddballs that make the set. Recommended for fans of hardcore country.

(1746, 11008, 'At The Mall', 'Recorded by college friends between 1988 and 1992, Baron Zen''s At the Mall sounds, well, a lot like something some music-loving kids would record between 1988 and 1992. The Joy Division, Black Flag, and Dead Milkmen influences are all there, as are the early hip-hop, pop, and even disco ones. It''s clearly music made by people who liked a lot of different styles (one of Baron Zen''s members, Chris Manak, aka DJ Peanut Butter Wolf, though he doesn''t show up on every song on the album -- only Sweet Steve, the band''s songwriter and main performer, has that honor -- went on to form the Stones Throw record label), and who have some fun toys (a four-track and drum machine, as well as a keyboard and some guitars) and a lot of free time. The covers of Joy Division''s "Walked in Line" and Debbie Deb''s "When I Hear Music" (which takes an almost industrial spin, and is actually pretty cool) are unpretentious and catchy, and the original pieces, albeit a little purposeless and messy, are guiltily enjoyable. Which means that although At the Mall isn''t a great record, it''s still a fun record; it''s about having a good time, not taking yourself seriously, hanging out with friends, and simple, fuzzy guitar riffs. No, the musicianship is not mind-blowing, the lyrics are not particularly inventive (an exception being "Shoes," which has Sweet Steve rapping about how he loves the accessory "more than the behind of a female"), and the raw attitude and anger that often define the work of young male artists and make it exciting even when it''s lacking in other areas is instead replaced by a more suburban apathetic -- or at least bored -- view of the world, but somehow this renders it all the more charming. It''s a glimpse into the life of some college students having fun and making a little fun of themselves and things around them in the process, and it''s worth checking out.', '2006-07-03 00:00:00', 0, 1, 2, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-05 16:43:55', '2015-02-16 15:47:12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1748, 11009, 'Backwoods Barbie', 'It''s been three years since Dolly Parton released a new album, and nearly two decades since she put out anything close to a mainstream country offering, so Backwoods Barbie ought to get some serious media attention, although it remains to be seen whether the now 62-year-old Parton will get much play on the new country stations. The first single from the album, the cloyingly wise "Better Get to Livin''," is certainly catchy enough, but the fact remains that Parton''s voice isn''t quite what it used to be and she wasn''t exactly Patsy Cline in the first place. What she is, and has been all these years, is a true iconic presence in country music, a shrewd marketer, an astute businesswoman (Backwoods Barbie appears from her own Dolly Records), and a frequently brilliant if understated songwriter (nine of the 12 tracks here are Parton originals). Unlike her last couple of albums, which were bluegrass-based, she isn''t trying to reinvent herself here, but works in her usual pop and country hybrid style (even tenderly covering Smokey Robinson''s "The Tracks of My Tears"), not trying too hard to be contemporary, although the production touches are there (the album was co-produced by Parton and her bandleader, guitarist Kent Wells), certainly, and her version of Betsy Ulmer and Craig Wiseman''s "Jesus & Gravity," even more than "Better Get to Livin''," could well find itself in regular rotation on new country radio stations, at least in a fair and equitable world. Other highlights here include the title song, which shows Parton still in tune with her public image (she really always has been, of course), and the beautiful and delicate original "Only Dreamin''," which shows that, beneath all the big wigs and glamour, Parton is still a fine songwriter with an uncommon sense of grace, economy, and wisdom. Backwoods Barbie might not break the bank out there, and it would take a good deal of marketing and luck for any of these tracks to hit the top of the new country charts, but it shows that Parton can still deliver the package in fine style and only the fools among us would ever count her down and out, no matter how many bluegrass albums she does.', '2008-02-26 00:00:00', 0, 1, 6, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-05 17:01:53', '2015-02-16 15:47:12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(1749, 11010, 'Be With', 'Koushik Ghosh is an admitted fan of Madlib, so it must have been overwhelming for him to be signed to his idol''s label, Stones Throw. Be With, a collection of his three EPs on one CD, appeared one year prior to the 2006 release of his debut album, Out My Window, but Koushik is not what you might expect to come out of a Stones Throw release. Yes, he''s a producer and a vocalist (though Koushik sings, not raps), but he creates melodic and textural works reminiscent of ''60s psych-pop, Shuggie Otis, or even Beck. Koushik''s soft, airy voice (styled perhaps on his heroes My Bloody Valentine) doesn''t act as the main attraction: rather, he uses it as a DJ would, as another sound to add to his songs. His words aren''t meant to be understood, they''re just supposed to flow in and out of the piece like every other component, and the elongated syllables add a nice contrast to the frequent speed and confusion in the instrumentation. Koushik is big on build-up -- starting out with a simple bassline, a few chords, a soft beat, adding on layer after layer, then slowly stripping everything until he''s almost where he started, before he builds it up again (a little differently this time -- the bass groove adds a few notes, the keys play more chords) and the song finally ends in a familiar riff or just fades slowly and softly away instead. It proves to be a good recipe: the album is pleasant and soft but not boring, and the tracks are surprisingly brief: they don''t continue on forever as often happens with looping. When Koushik is especially successful, like in the hauntingly melancholic "Ew," it''s fantastic, and the song begs to be longer, and when he''s less than spectacular (the lackluster "Back to the End," for example), it''s nice that most of the songs on the album fall far short of the three-minute mark. Yes, by the end of the album his formula is well understood, but it produces such likable songs that it doesn''t really matter. Koushik is one to keep an eye on, and it will be interesting to see what he will do with a full album. He holds great promise; he''ll just have to learn how to put it all together.', '2005-07-26 00:00:00', 0, 1, 3, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-05 17:09:40', '2015-02-16 15:47:12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(1750, 11012, 'Beat Konducta Vol. 3 & 4: In India', 'As prolific as he is talented, producer extraordinaire Madlib moved east for his second Beat Konducta installment, In India. Unlike Vol. 1-2, which was themed around an imaginary film, Vol. 3-4 has no clear overarching purpose, and the 34 tracks connect to one another only because their samples were all taken from Indian records from the ''70s and ''80s. And it''s here that Madlib''s high output works both positively and negatively for him. On one hand, he''s able to offer an extraordinary amount of different sounds all tabled around a unifying idea (the sitar, the tabla), from the very RZA-esque "Smoke Circles" to the percussive "Freeze" to the fuzzy, layered vocals of "Dancing Girls Theme." But he also relies almost solely on his own innate and insane amount of natural skill, without always thinking much about the finished product, too excited about the next thing he''s going to create to even remember what he did a few minutes before, and this carelessness shows up now and again, weakening the overall effect of the record. Cuts like "Masala," "Another Getaway," "Dark Alley Incidental Music," and "The Rip Off (Scene 3)" seem hastily thrown together without much consideration for either the album as a whole or even the tracks themselves, a little too droney and atonal to do much more but loop around tiredly. Of course, this same kind of approach, this flexibility, can also produce some pretty great work, and fortunately most of Vol. 3-4: Beat Konducta in India falls into that category. "Accordion for Raj," for example, uses not only the title instrument, but also a nice, shaky MPC beat and an electric guitar to fill in the sound, "Onthatnewthing" plays with ascending and descending scales, while "(Variations)" is able to transition between two different musical ideas (as Madlib is wont to do) cleanly and appropriately (such is not the case, however, with "Main Title," whose lack of continuity is more annoying than anything else). The album''s not without its weak points, that''s to be sure, but it''s still, overall, another interesting, and generally impressive, accomplishment from the master himself.', '2007-08-24 00:00:00', 0, 1, 2, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-05 17:20:29', '2015-02-16 15:47:12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1786, 11393, 'Radio', 'Six years passed since Ky-Mani Marley released his sophomore set, Many More Roads, but the Marley name''s cachet in the reggae scene hadn''t yet dissipated, and with the strength of his previous sets, Radio debuted at the top of the reggae chart. This is quite a feat, since Radio is not a reggae album, with its only link guesting singer Tessanne Chin hot off her hit "Hide Away." None of Marley''s half-siblings appears, no veteran reggae musicians wave the black, green, and gold, and there''s not even a single dancehall producer to boost Ky-Mani''s Jamaican cred. There is, however, "The Hustler," which is obviously aimed at a world audience, and catchy enough to take the clubs and airwaves by storm. But that infectious roots reggae number is the exception to the record''s rule of straight-up hip-hop and R&B. But because Marley is a Marley, one can tease out reggae elements, all of which would go unremarked if delivered by any other artist. Radio''s atmospheres are overwhelmingly introspective, if not outright brooding, its auras shadowed, at times gloomy, with the bluesy "Breakdown" pushing toward the gothic; the inspiration could be dread roots, but not necessarily. Some of the basslines would work well in a reggae context, a few of the brass passages too, but at this point, one''s really stretching. Several of the themes are a better fit, notably the heartfelt plea for Jah''s mercy "I Pray" and the militant "The March," wherein Marley girds himself for life and Armageddon. Of course, deceitful women are a universal affliction, but only someone raised in the reggae world would call theirs "Jezebel." And much of the set revolves around relationships, from the slack "Slow Roll" to the fiery "So Hot," and on to such romantic numbers as "Royal Vibes," "Conversation," and "I Got You." But Marley isn''t merely a loverman; he''s also a "Ghetto Soldier," but one who still feels the need to establish his street cred, as he does on this powerful, part-autobiographical/part-bring-it-on number. That''s the toughest of the set, though the defiant and exuberant "I''m Back" runs it a close second, as Marley announces his return with style, with his posse, rappers Young Buck and Louie Rankin, watching his back. It''s one of five combo numbers within; others feature guest rappers Maintain and Gail Gotti, and R&B star Mya. All told, Radio is an incredibly potent album, with a great flow, minimalistic in feel but thick with atmosphere, the lyrics personal, often thoughtful, and delivered with all the power and emotion Marley possesses. A hip-hop powerhouse parading as a reggae set, the album will blow your socks off, even if you were expecting a one-drop set.', '2007-09-25 00:00:00', 0, 1, 11, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-16 16:20:32', '2015-02-16 15:47:13', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It also follows his excellent Return of the Mac album by just a little over a year, although Prodigy has taken to calling that effort a "mixtape" even when it looked and played like your standard issue full-length. Put these two facts together and it might explain why the ambitious H.N.I.C., Pt. 2 is a near masterwork, an almost classic that just can''t lift its head over the bar Return of the Mac placed so high. Compared to that album, H.N.I.C., Pt. 2 is a much more varied and traditional effort with producer Alchemist stepping aside occasionally to let folks like Apex, Sid Roams, and Prodigy''s Mobb Deep brother Havoc behind the boards. Roams gives "ABC" a wonderful nightmare texture while Apex kills on "It''s Nothing" by hyping up Prodigy''s usual horror show backing tracks into something much more frantic and brittle. Havoc''s church organ loop gives "I Want Out" a fittingly dramatic sound for a pre-prison goodbye song, plus a reminder of how much the Mobb Deep attitude will be missed. "This is usually the part of the movie where the pistol comes out" is how Prodigy deals with his inescapable situation, but his promise to return and dominate is sure. The stunning "Veterans Memorial, Pt. 2" sheds light on where it all began as the rapper recounts the first jewelry store robbery he pulled off with dad and tells of childhood memories of Havoc''s brother "Killer" ("They shot him in his head /Killer ran home/Took some Advil/Pulled the bullet out on his own"). Besides being Alchemist''s greatest moment, "Young Veterans" warns the freshman thug that this desolate life is no place for the weak, but when the redundant murder numbers begin halfway through, the album starts to numb and the stories become less effective. Strangest and most disposable of all is the "ABC" remix which uses some kind of translation software to turn the Prodigy''s English verses into Spanish language rapping. Odd that his last track before lockup would be a gimmicky, oddball sounding remix, plus there''s an overall feeling that the uneven H.N.I.C., Pt. 2 was rushed. Not so surprising considering P''s legal situation and taking the highlights into account, it''s even forgivable. Hardcore fans will be down with every cold hard minute, everybody else gets a B+ effort, and the hip-hop game as a whole gets a really good reason to save Prodigy''s place at the table for the next three-and-a-half years.', '2008-04-22 00:00:00', 0, 1, 2, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-23 14:43:19', '2015-02-16 15:47:13', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(1804, 11701, 'Ode To The Ghetto', 'Although Ode to the Ghetto is only Guilty Simpson''s first official full-length, the Detroit rapper has been around for much longer than that, making his first appearance (to be heard much outside of the Motor City) on the 2003 Jaylib album Champion Sound, thanks in part to his friendship with J Dilla. In 2006, Guilty signed to Stones Throw and previewed his style on the label''s Chrome Children compilations as well as on guest appearances on records by Phat Kat, Percee P, Dabrye, and Black Milk. These tracks gave a good taste of what the gravel-voiced MC could bring, but Ode to the Ghetto truly shows off the whole man. Which isn''t to say that this is a flawless album: Guilty''s got a few clunky lines in here -- and his rhymes are never especially complicated to begin with -- and things slow down considerably towards the end of the record (an exception being the closer, which features verses from three of his fellow Almighty Dreadnaughtz, and is a great, energetic way to end things). But most of the production is excellent, and the MC broaches multiple subjects, from jealous girlfriends ("She Won''t Stay at Home") to corrupt cops ("Pigs") to life in the inner city ("In the Ghetto") to his own lyrical dominance ("My Moment"), with his own particular insight and creativity. The title track especially is impressive and versatile, with an excellent beat from a track off Oh No''s 2007 album Dr. No''s Oxperiment, "Ghetto," neither demonizing nor sugarcoating life on the streets, rather explaining it for what it is and its personal effect on the rapper ("It might not get your praise/But I love the hood where I was raised/It made me the person I am today/And a part of every word I say"). "I Must Love You," too, with its typically off-kilter Dilla beat, is about feeling confused in a relationship, juxtaposing the line "Sometimes you make me feel like a king" with "Sometimes you make me feel real low," and is sweet and brash at the same time. That''s the thing about Guilty Simpson, though: he''s not easily pegged or categorized. Yes, his beats are often dirty and synth-ridden (mostly courtesy of D12''s Mr. Porter) and he gruffly rhymes as frequently about sex and drugs as any mainstream rapper, but he''s also deliberate and thoughtful and doesn''t depend on a throbbing bass drum to make his records pop. Which just means that Ode to the Ghetto is an album that demands some time to actually be listened to in order for its full impact to really be felt, but an album that resonates deeply once it sets in.', '2008-03-25 00:00:00', 0, 1, 2, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-23 15:10:53', '2015-02-16 15:47:13', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
