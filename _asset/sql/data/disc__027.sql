(1709, 10696, 'War To End All Wars', '80年代初期於美國發跡的瑞典籍速彈吉他之神Yngwie Malmsteen，在首張處女作獲得葛萊美獎提名最佳演奏專輯之後，即刻被全球搖滾與吉他界奉為天人，除了走紅美、歐、亞洲之外，更在蘇聯時代的列寧格勒寫下劃時代的演唱會歷史代表作，爾後Yngwie逐漸將重心轉移到歐、日，他的吉他神技也因此突然消失在北美之境，直至多年後的今日，Yngwie終於決定再度向美國的音樂市場「宣戰」，讓新一代的美國人見識他這位古典速彈吉他之神的不思義神技，而他這次帶來的便是千呼萬喚始出來的「以戰止戰」!\r\n  由於上作"Alchemy"(1999)回歸早期的音樂路線而大獲好評，於是Yngwie也將這股氣勢繼續加在本作"War To End All Wars之中"。由封面設計來看，還特別延攬了知名畫家Frank Frazetta來執筆，事實上Frank的"Conan"系列畫作正是在描寫英雄與史詩的戰爭內容，完全符合本專輯「以戰止戰」的標題意義。在音樂的結構方面，Yngwie刻意將吉他音色調重，其Heavy的程度偏向早期的"Marching Out"與中期的"The Seventh Sign"，以彌補音樂太偏向古典而喪失金屬的厚重原味。這次Yngwie也扮演起貝斯手的角色，鏗鏘有力的bass彈奏與超高速的bass/guitar/keyboard對飆在"Instru Mental Institution"一曲中一覽無疑。如果說Yngwie是現代的帕格尼尼一點也不為過，他在"Prophet Of Doom"的中段部分大展帕格尼尼「二十四首隨響曲」末曲的精華片段，並加以改編成neo-classical速彈曲式，不愧是新古典速彈宗師! 值得一提的是，這次Yngwie尚帶來印度與阿拉伯曲風來增加音樂的變化性，如加入電西塔琴的"Crucify"，與運用了Conga與中國鑼鼓的"Treasure  >From The East"兩曲，更令人歎為觀止!\r\n\r\n\r\nCover Art News\r\nSeptember 27: Yngwie''s new management is in discussions with legendary artist Frank Frazetta to have Frazetta supply some special artwork to grace the cover of Yngwie''s new album, War to End All Wars. Frazetta''s unique style set the trend for heroic/fantasy art decades ago and continues to inspire new artists today--you''ve seen his artwork on the covers of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels as well as the Conan the Barbarian series, to just give a few examples. The artwork chosen for Yngwie''s album cover is in the grand "Conan" style (it is an image from Frazetta''s famous "Death Dealer" series) and perfectly illustrates the title song. The cover should start showing up in magazine ads soon, and a high-quality scan of the art will be uploaded here as soon as we get the green light to do so. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nComments from Yngwie''s Management: \r\nHere''s the early buzz on Yngwie Malmsteen''s new album, which is slated for a November 22, 2000, release. Album title is "War To End All Wars". There is plenty of intense stuff here to satisfy all Yngwie fans, as well as several surprises and departures from the traditional Malmsteen album. \r\n\r\nOf special interest is the TONE of the guitar on this album. The rhythm guitars are "beefy" and "meaty". For those of you who like Yngwie''s lead tone on albums such as Rising Force, Marching Out, and The Seventh Sign, you will LOVE this new album. A lot of time was spent in the studio A/B-ing different amps and overdrive pedals to get that special warm, thick, smooth, and bell-like tone that vintage Yngwie fans like so much. \r\n\r\nThis is Yngwie''s first album following his departure from his past management and signing with a new American label. You can hear the renewed energy and enthusiasm in his songwriting and playing. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a winner \r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nCMJ Review\r\n\r\nAmy Sciarretto: CMJ New Music Report Issue: 692 - Nov 20, 2000 \r\nAccess Online HERE.\r\nYNGWIE J. MALMSTEEN''S RISING FORCE - War To End All Wars: Yngwie''s back, and so is the J. And while we''re calling it a comeback, Rising Force is along for the ride, too. Here the dexterous Mr. Malmsteen -- arguably one of the most talented, agile axeman to ever stroke a six-string -- sends guitar geeks another gem to drool over. War To End All Wars is, of course, a platform for Yng''s awe-inspiring guitar solos. Still, the power-metal vocals of Rising Force''s Mark Bowles take some of the pressure off the virtuosic Yng, making War To End All Wars an actual album, as opposed to a collection of classically influenced, tablature-riffic guitar parts. Retreat into a netherworld of prog with "Crucify" and "Bad Reputation." \r\nMetalBlitz Gives Album 5-Star Rating\r\nYngwie Malmsteen''s "Crucify" is #1 top requested download from MetalBlitz.com on Nov. 10, 2000!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nAlbum Review: War To End All Wars \r\nReview by Dave Epstein\r\nAccess Online Here.\r\nGlorious uber-metal excess from the fleet-fingered Yngwie! It sounds like 1985 all over again! Anybody remember "Crucify," that jaw-dropping Bible lesson (told from the point of view of Pontius Pilate) from ''80s Christian speed metallists Bloodgood? No? Your loss, baby, but this track of the same name from Yngwie''s latest album may be even better. Hard to tell if the crucified individual in question is actually Jesus Christ (lyrics like "Your soul will burn forever / Bringing eternal pain" sound a little too vengeful to be coming from the mouth of God''s only son), but the sheer, over-the-top drama matches Bloodgood''s song blow for glorious blow. And when it comes to pure, unbridled shred, nobody touches Yngwie; "Crucify" opens with thirty seconds of shuddering bass-string hammer-ons, and gets even more insane from there (the man''s style may not have changed much since 1985, but who cares?). Throw in some top-notch howling by Mark Boals, a phalanx of helium-pumped backing vocals, and even an electric sitar (!), and you''ve got six transcendent minutes of uber-metal bombast. Let me see your fucking lighters! -- Dan Epstein \r\n\r\nDan Epstein is a Los Angeles-based journalist and pop-culture historian whose work has appeared in L.A.

Malmsteen, Spitfire Records. \r\nReview by: Christopher Thelen\r\nAccess Online HERE. \r\n\r\nAlthough I''m familiar with Yngwie Malmsteen''s work, having heard his playing since he started his solo career in 1984 (and seeing him open for AC/DC in 1985), I can''t say that I''m well-schooled in his entire discography. I''m certain I''m missing an album or two from his discography, despite the fact my publicist friends were nice enough to send me the latest reissues of Malmsteen''s "forgotten" releases from the ''90s. \r\n\r\nBut after listening to an advance copy of War To End All Wars, Malmsteen''s upcoming release, it''s almost like I''m listening to an incomplete picture. It''s almost as if you need to be familiar with everything that Malmsteen has done to this point to understand where he''s coming from musically. If you''re not as well-versed, you''re left with a rather confusing picture. \r\n\r\nRecorded with vocalist Mark Boals (who just recently announced his departure from the band, according to Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles), Malmsteen continues to crank out the classical-influenced metal that he''s made a career out of - and I''m not suggesting that''s a bad thing. Malmsteen still remains one of the most exciting guitarists fighting for your entertainment dollar. But as this album proves, such an approach can easily be hit-or-miss. \r\n\r\nTake, for example, "Prophet Of Doom," a song whose Queen-like harmony vocals and John Macaluso''s thrash-style drum work make this track stand out. It might not have the same kind of magic as Malmsteen''s earlier hits, but it has its own unique charm that makes it equally special. (If you''re wondering how anyone could play a bass riff with the same lightning speed as the guitar line, just look at the credits... Malmsteen handles all the bass work. ''Nuff said.) Ditto goes for "Bad Reputation," a song which almost sounds like it could have come from any of a number of other bands, albeit without the classical riffs from Malmsteen. \r\n\r\nThen, there are the experiments that don''t work as well. One such example is "Tarot," a song which occasionally strikes my fancy just for Malmsteen''s riffage. Other tracks, such as "Masquerade" or "Wizard," have the technical expertise, but they lack any real emotion lyrically, and they don''t allow the listener to really connect with them on the level that Malmsteen et al. would have liked them to. \r\n\r\nMalmsteen''s instrumental work, naturally, is without peer; selections like "Arpegios From Hell" and "Prelude" all are just more wonderful padding to Malmsteen''s musical resume. \r\n\r\nMaybe part of the problem with War To End All Wars is that it comes on the tail end of a period in Malmsteen''s career where his work wasn''t getting noticed in America. Now that the bulk of those discs are out on the market, people can play one major game of "catch-up". Maybe then, War To End All Wars will sound more "in place" with the rest of Malmsteen''s discography. On its own, it has its moments, but it comes off sounding like a painting which is only half-complete. \r\nRATING: C+ \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nHardRadio Review\r\nHard Radio Rates "War to End All Wars" 8.5 out of 10:\r\n\r\n"I mean, what do you want from this man? It''s hard to believe that people had much to bitch about with Alchemy, lots of blinding soloing, thumping riffs, retro power. . . it''s what we begged him for. Well, again and even moreso, I can''t see anybody (who knows what they''re in for) not totally bowing in prostration to this sledge of personality-rich power metal. So what are the tweaks? Well, I hear a more desperate and passionate vocal performance, Mark Boals'' technician pipes approaching the anguish of a life sentence in a castle dungeon. But drummer John Macaluso is trying valiantly to break him out, putting up a rhythmic battle that seems designed to whip Yngwie into a frenzy. And the riffs are their own type of granite ballast, the metal mania of this album letting up only for the tosser instrumentals, the drunken U.S. bonus track (Yngwie and a drunken Police cover band buddy from back home stumble to the studio) and the incredibly valid family man ballad Miracle Of Life, mature, level-headed, maybe the album''s best track. Even melodic rocker Bad Reputation thumps and bumps with football persuasion. Yngwie is pretty much the man with a past that is most obsessively committed to, married to, and having his way with, all the rules of power metal practiced by those vacant of such a past. So there''s a pride there, a pride in knowing that he wrote most of these rules, and is therefore granted poetic license when he feels like letting it rip. I was going to say ''putting on a clinic'', but this record is anything but clinical, despite the halting idiom in which it operates."   \r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nFan Club Director''s Interview with Yngwie\r\nby phone, October 21, 2000\r\nAnne: I thought I''d check in with you to see how you survived the recent publicity media blitz. Have you caught up on your sleep yet? \r\n\r\nYngwie: Not yet--I''m still walking around like I''m shell-shocked or something. On top of jetlag from flying to Tokyo for a few days, then to London for a few more, then to Stockholm, when I got to New York . . . those four days in NYC were totally insane! I was up by 8 a.m. every morning [loud laugh from Anne, who knows that Yngwie is the world''s worst night-owl]--I know, I know, but it''s true. They had every moment of my day scheduled with some kind of interview, chat, or photo session, from like 9 a.m. to past midnight. Mind you, I''m not complaining because I haven''t had this kind of coverage in America in years, but it really blew me away. A year or so ago, AOL and Yahoo turned me down flat--they weren''t the least bit interested, but now here I am talking to the dudes on the phone, doing back-to-back chats and interviews.\r\n\r\nAnne: AOL proudly proclaimed that they had snagged your first-ever Internet chat session. What did you think of it? \r\n\r\nYngwie: Well, as you know, it was conducted by phone and I didn''t see what was on the actual computer screen. So it seemed really slow to me… the guy on the phone would ask me a question, and I''d have to speak really slowly so he could type my answers. I tend to give somewhat wordy responses to questions (laughs), so I''m afraid some of the answers people saw on the screen were highly condensed versions of what I really said. \r\n\r\nAnne: Did it bother you that some of the questions were so basic and that must have been asked a million times before during your career? \r\n\r\nYngwie: Yes and no. I don''t mind repeating some of my history for new fans who maybe have just discovered my music and weren''t part of the whole neo-classical shred scene in the ''80s. But I must tell you, I thought I would lose my mind when I had to explain to every interviewer that ''Rising Force'' is not a new band. I have a solo career, with hand-picked musicians who support me in each new endeavor, and as such they perform with me under the aegis of "Yngwie J. Malmsteen''s Rising Force." But Rising Force is not a band unto itself, like say, Aerosmith or Metallica. Ozzy Osbourne, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani--these guys all have solo careers with various musicians playing on each album, and the same is true for me. \r\n\r\nAnne: Are you surprised by the volume of interest Spitfire has been able to generate for you in America in such a short amount of time? \r\n\r\nYngwie: Absolutely. The USA is responding so beautifully--it''s like a dream come true. I really feel like I''m waking up from some long, dark trance or something . . . almost like I''ve been in suspended animation and am suddenly being revived in a new decade. I''m really thrilled how the buzz on the new album has started to take off. In a bizarre way, it has kind of helped that I''ve been invisible here in the States until now, because suddenly everyone wants to talk to me and find out what I''m all about. Here''s an example of what I mean: I sat in the studios of New York''s two biggest rock stations and did some listener call-in shows. They played cuts like "Prophet of Doom," "Bad Reputation," "Masquerade" and the album''s title song. And we''d get callers who were blown away by the sound of those songs, saying things like "Duuuuude, you really kick Major Ass" and "Man, you are unbelievable! You ROCK!" As you know, it''s been a long time since I got that kind of reaction from radio airplay in the U.S. I''ve enjoyed really good radio exposure in Japan for a number of years, but I wished it could happen elsewhere as well--and now it is.\r\n\r\nAnne: I''ve been told that the promotional "listening parties" held in Tokyo and Stockholm went really well. \r\n\r\nYngwie: Yes, they did. The event in Tokyo was a much more structured situation, where we had a specific agenda. Five specifically selected songs were played for the audience, and then I joined them and gave a live guitar demonstration, followed by a question and answer session. This was the first public airing of the songs before a live audience, and the reaction was great. In Stockholm, it was much more casual. The Hard Rock Cafe there started playing all my old albums early in the night, and then when I got there they played the entire new album continually. It was a really relaxed atmosphere, just like hanging out there with a bunch of buddies. My old friend Jon Norum stopped by, too. The crowd there was actually pretty surprised when I showed up--I think they had expected that my appearance was just a rumor. Reaction to the new music was great there too, but nothing like the scene when I got to New York. I was totally unprepared for that! \r\n\r\nAnne: I know you haven''t been following anything on the Internet, but there have been so many late-breaking announcements about the new album (cover art, sound clips, tour updates, etc.) that trying to keep on top of it all is making us all crazy! The Spitfire marking team has been really aggressive. \r\n\r\nYngwie: Yeah, Paul Bibeau [Spitfire Records President] says he''s really happy to have me on the label, and I had a great time hanging out with him in NY. The publicity guys ran me ragged, but it was all definitely worth it.\r\n\r\nAnne: Right, and a lot of it is happening across the Internet, especially now that radio stations are happening online, like KNAC and Hard Radio, where your songs can regular exposure. And as you might expect, clips of all the songs are now making their way onto various sites. \r\n\r\nYngwie: I guess it''s a good thing. I have mixed feelings about the Internet. Most of what I see out there is so negative, especially in these places where everybody can become an instant expert and critic, and there''s no way to stop ridiculous rumors from becoming fact in uninformed readers'' minds. I know that sites like yours and those of legitimate fans do a lot of good, but there''s such a tidal wave of bad stuff out there, I don''t even want to see it. It just makes me so angry and frustrated that both your public and private life can be so… violated by people who don''t even know you or care what you feel. It''s not right, but I guess there''s nothing that can be done to stop it. On the positive side, I do appreciate all the people who like my music and want to use the Internet to introduce new people to it. One thing I did discover in these chats is that there is a whole new wave of young fans, in their early teens and 20s, who can''t believe what they''re hearing and are truly hungry for more. I love my core fan base that''s been with me for years, but to interact with these new fans who are just discovering what you can do on the guitar besides strum a few chords is quite gratifying. \r\n\r\nAnne: So, now you''re home, trying to relax and get ready to go out on tour in a few weeks. Are you looking forward to it? \r\n\r\nYngwie: To be honest, I can''t wait to get out there. It doesn''t matter to me what order I play in or how long my set it--I just plan to go onstage and knock the audience flat--period. This new music is so strong, it''s going to make a lasting impression on anybody who hears it live. \r\n\r\nAnne: For many fans, the pairing of you and Ronnie James Dio on the same tour is a dream come true. Any chance you might play a song or two onstage with him? \r\n\r\nYngwie: It''s possible… but I''d have to talk to him about it, of course. We''ve done that before, and it could happen again. It would be fun. So…. I hope all the fans out there will come to the shows. I plan to have a blast, and I hope everybody else there will too!
