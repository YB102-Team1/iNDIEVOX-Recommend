(1275, 8788, 'Bloom', 'Although this is the duo''s debut album, Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden have been influential figures on the club music scene for some time, remixing tracks by the likes of Annie Lennox ("Pavement Cracks"), Sarah McLachlan ("Fallen"), and even Britney Spears ("Me Against the Music"). For Bloom, Gabriel & Dresden pulled together a handful of tracks by artists they''re especially enthusiastic about (including McLachlan, Guy Gerber, Audioholics, and Above & Beyond) and packed them in among original material from their back catalog and a few new compositions written just for this album. The result is an impressive two-disc set of stylistically varied club music on which the occasional disappointments (Gerber''s awful "Stoppage Time," Lili Haydn''s barely tolerable "Anything") are nicely outweighed by such moments of brilliance as Andain''s gorgeous cover of the Depeche Mode chestnut "Here Is the House" and a truly spectacular remix of Dido''s "Don''t Leave Home." Sarah McLachlan''s contribution is a lovely little song called "World On Fire," presented here in a Junkie XL club mix that would have been killer if he had just kicked up the funk factor a little bit. The "dub" versions could have been a bit dubbier, and it would have been nice to hear a few more breakbeats in among the thumpy house tracks, but this is really a very impressive debut.

(1276, 8793, 'The Ballad of Lawless Soirez', 'In lesser hands, Gill Landry''s tableaus would come off contrived; his meticulously depicted portraits of the underside, unfulfilled, undesired, and unworthy would be busted as bogus. But Landry''s too sharp a storyteller, too tuned-in a craftsman, too real, to find himself on the wrong side of suspicion. Like Tom Waits, John Prine, Steve Earle, and recent-years Dylan, Landry is down-to-business believable. His songs carry their own persona, and though they may be creepy and otherworldly at times and nasty and grubby at others, they''re familiar while remaining at arm''s length. Just as you know the stark, dark, sleek B&W abandoned pulp-noir street of the CD cover, even if you''ve never been unlucky enough to find yourself there, you''ve run into the soused slobs of "Dixie" and the sorry-ass denizen of "Ugly Town" and the dark clouds of "Mutiny" and the "graveyard eyes" of "Desiree." You may not want Landry''s characters over for dinner, but you recognize them when you see them. When Landry tags the subject of "Gasoline Legs" as having "nothing to lose/Poisoned with a vision/Back turned to the ocean/Sleeping in the arms of hurricanes," his words, though hardly translucent, are clear and picturesque nonetheless. He''s never a waster of images, nor of sounds: the only embellishments he chooses are the ones he needs. With its mariachi horns and mournful violins and time-warp clarinet, the twangy guitars and understated organ, The Ballad of Lawless Soirez creates its own world, somewhere between "the shoulders of highways," the "twisted streets" of Paris, and the great "loneliness in the middle of nowhere." Landry is schooled and immersed in the great Americana musical traditions and he wears them well, his voice just labored enough to ensure he''s been there and back and just homey enough to make you want to walk his lonely avenues.', '2007-01-30 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-25 15:01:39', '2015-02-16 15:46:59', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

With each succeeding album, the Vancouver, Canada, band''s sound moved farther away from the snide vocals and air-raid guitars of its debut, and closer to the anthemic sugar-punk popularized by Blink-182. But widespread (i.e., American) success continued to elude Gob, despite numerous Warped Tour appearances and the explosive success of fellow Canadian brats Sum 41. That will all change with Foot in Mouth Disease, their debut full-length for Arista Records. Producer Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World) has boxed up any remaining traces of the Sex Pistols'' swagger from Gob''s early work and buried it in L.A. Reid''s backyard. Replacing that are 14 mind-bogglingly catchy jawbreakers that are closer to the Knack than the Clash. The pogoing "Lemon-Aid," "This Evil World," and "Give up the Grudge" arrive just in time for summer; the latter even includes gratuitous swearing on this, the explicit version of the album.

The album blasts out 20 tracks in under an hour, none breaking the three-minute mark. There''s plenty of dual vocal/guitar interplay between co-frontmen Tom and Theo, liberal use of cuss words, and even a few cheekily snotty song titles ("Custard''s Last 1 Nite Stand," "Censorshit"). Unlike the Clash or the Sex Pistols, both obvious influences, Gob is neither political nor very anti-establishment. Their agenda is delivered through anthems like "Fuck Them," "Asshole T.V.," and "Leave Me Alone"; it wouldn''t be surprising if a song called "Hell No, I Won''t Clean My Room" was next. Their desires are also clear ("I Want You Back Baby," "You''re Too Cool"). The social and cultural underpinnings that drove their sonic forebears aren''t relevant to Gob, or their young fans. It''s the genre''s stylistic elements -- transmuted through buzz-saw guitars and snide vocals -- that are important.

Like fellow sepia-toned Chicago collective the Pinetop Seven, GLS have a gift for melody and atmosphere that is nearly hypnotic, but where the Pinetop gang often shifts the dynamic and runs screaming into the forest, the Swimmers just kind of tread water, resulting in an audio experience that can just as easily infect the listener with drooping eyelids as it can repeated bouts of cathartic Sunday morning contemplation.', '2007-02-20 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-26 13:33:34', '2015-02-16 15:46:59', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

As pickers, the Hackensaw Boys aren''t exactly the Del McCoury Band, but their chops are at least as good (if not better) than the average act you''ll see at a bluegrass festival, and they sound like a band, with a strong ensemble feel that more than compensates for their (very) occasional rough spots. The Hackensaw Boys can play at warp speed on tunes like "F.D.R.," "Sweet Petunia" and "Gospel Plow," but they can also connect on more measured material, and mid-tempo songs like "Baltimore" and "Hobo" demonstrate the strength of their songwriting chops, which avoid rural clichés in favor of honest but heartfelt stories of Appalachian life. The production on Look Out is simple and effective, capturing the details of the performances without adding too much gloss, and the finished project is a record that proves musicians can respect tradition without letting it hold them back. Look Out is bluegrass played with the touch of sincere acolytes as well the spirit of a rough-and-ready garage band, and the Hackensaw Boys are the rare group that can make both sides of this formula work equally well.', '2007-01-19 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-26 16:29:15', '2015-02-16 15:46:59', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1303, 8975, 'Eveningland', 'Hem made a quiet stir with their 2001 release Rabbit Songs, notable for its lush orchestral backdrop and the casually sexy and innocent whisperings of vocalist Sally Ellyson. The fact that a gentle folk ensemble could even be heard amidst the Britneys and Xtinas of the new millennium is a testament to Hem''s intangible qualities. Fans of their debut will be happy to hear that their 2004 follow-up Eveningland is completely devoid of techno drum loops, pitch-corrected teen angst, and the only super-famous guest star is the quietly brilliant (and unobtrusive) Josh Rouse. Clarinets provide reedy countermelodies to the sighing violins, and campfire acoustic guitars buoy Ellyson''s lullabies along on burlap mists through dusty woodcut images. Largely orchestrated by songwriter Dan Messé, the songs retain the timeless quality of Appalachian folk music without ever sounding dated. The music occasionally ranges through blissful ''70s AM pop (the Carpenters), with hints of the big British folk ensembles (Pentangle, Fairport Convention), and sighing pedal steel reminiscent of terrific ''90s Americana (Cowboy Junkies, Mojave Three) and dreamy pop (Mazzy Star, the Sundays) all of which assemble on the same wooden front porch for a starry evening of acoustic introspection. The album begins subtly with the understated "The Fire Thief," moving slowly into the bright ballad "Receiver" and through a warmly subdued version of the Johnny Cash/June Carter duet "Jackson." The only fault with the album may be that it is not as surprising as their debut, and since it is simply more of the same terrific music, it doesn''t broadside the listener in the same new and fresh way. The Hem project began as an attempt to create something lasting, and Eveningland proves that their debut was no fluke. While Hem will probably never appear on MTV (not even early in the morning) or get 30 spins a week on Hot Hits Z-101, their music may sneak into the hearts of unassuming listeners through NPR''s All Things Considered and maybe on a CD sampler in a roots music magazine, and those lucky listeners will cherish these songs, holding them close to their hearts with eyes closed and smiles wide, knowing that they hold something truly precious.', '2004-10-05 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-31 12:45:34', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(1304, 8975, 'Funnel Cloud', 'Hem delighted fans and newcomers with their debut, Rabbit Songs, and its follow up, Eveningland. The pair could have -- and perhaps should have -- been released as a double-CD set; they sounded that similar to one another. Hem drew inevitable comparisons to the Cowboy Junkies because of Sally Ellyson''s laid-back, clear vocal style, and sometimes to 10,000 Maniacs. although the latter never came close musically to this band''s quiet power. The sheer gentleness and tenderness of Hem''s earlier records were a sure draw, but after two albums the average listener felt as if Hem may have taken their sound as far as it could go. Fortunately, this simply isn''t so. Dan Messe (piano, glockenspiel, celeste and harmony vocals) and Gary Maurer (guitar, harmonica, mandolin and harmony vocals) are founding members and the band''s two principal songwriters, with guitarist and harmony vocalist Steve Curtis contributing songs as well. This trio looked deep and hard into their sound and came up with something beautifully different, though not so different as to alienate the faithful. Funnel Cloud is a much more lush affair and showcases Ellyson''s vocals in an entirely new way. Self-produced, the songs here are of a much wider variety and reveal an entirely new dimension of the trio. While Hem remains committed to acoustic music, the electric guitars, pedal steels, found sounds, and tighter arrangements on Funnel Cloud showcase Ellyson as a passionate singer who perfectly interprets her bandmates lyrics and musical ideas.\r\n\r\nThe brief, droney, acoustic opener "Go Easy Now," which has the timeless sound of a traditional folk song isn''t so much folksy as it delves deep into the ether of historical balladry with Ellyson upfront evoking the sadness, resignation, and lonely space of all the great singers from Norma Waterson to Hazel Dickens. On "He Came to Meet Me," the country-tinged sound begins to kiss inside the frame of Curtis'' tune. It''s a love song that is dressed in cello and violin, piano, guitar, and pedal steel as it wanders through a country shuffle. One can feel the anticipation and the gratitude in the clarity of Ellyson''s voice. When it all gels in the strolling, gradually erupting "Not California," the presence of need, both spiritual and erotic, makes its presence felt. Ellyson''s control is complete as the band builds gently, at first, to bring her up and out of her known persona. She can reach into herself and they know it; they go deep with her. It''s such a perfectly natural collaboration it feels like this band has been together for decades. Ellyson''s vocal talents are just beginning to shine, but it''s the songs that make them radiant. The sense of dynamic and texture on Funnel Cloud is deeply nuanced, caressed instead of coerced. When Ellyson gets to "I''m the one who wants to be the one you''re with tonight" everything swells to the breaking point and never quite does, thankfully. The back-to-back songs "Too Late to Turn Back Now" and "The Pills Stopped Working" are mirror images. The former is a straight-up country song that stretches the whole band while sounding as natural as if they''ve been playing road songs forever. The strings go far beyond the excesses of Nash Vegas, however. The latter, "The Pills Stopped Working," takes the country music to a rock edge with just a hint of blues. One can actually picture Joan Baez singing this song in her current incarnation. The band spreads itself out but not thin. The harmony vocals behind Ellyson are the reins of restraint that allow her to creep out on top of the edge, and Bob Hoffnar''s pedal steel whines in the foreground and creeps to the background. There is grit, fresh hums, and mud in the lyrics and Ellyson sings them with an honesty that is unflinching; she never gives up hope. "Hotel Fire" and "Great Houses of New York" both slip into the late 19th century parlor for their inspiration; they''re just gorgeously arranged and played with such elegance and restraint, they feel like songs that have been around since then. "I''ll Dream of You Tonight," is a country love song full of such longing, lost on the road, lost in the company of strangers, lost in the company of an aching heart, that it can only take comfort in tomorrow and the assurance that love is waiting. Funnel Cloud is the site on the horizon, where what''s here and now is beautiful and utterly serene, but what lies just behind the next cloud is a storm brewing so memory, loss, hope, desire, and the stillness of the present are all and everything there is. This is easily the band''s finest outing to date; it shows that they have more ideas than can be contained in the space of a single recording.

(1306, 8975, 'No Word From Tom', 'If it sounds somewhat odd to switch labels and release an album of "covers, rarities, outtakes, demos and live recordings," that''s because it is rather odd. These are the types of items, after all, that usually show up on a box set if a group stays together long enough to warrant one. Be that as it may, No Word From Tom, Hem''s third album (following Rabbit Songs in 2001 and Eveningland in 2004), is made up of odds and ends from the band''s five year history. The collection begins with Sally Ellyson''s a cappella rendering of "All the Pretty Little Horses," one of the songs that served as her introduction to the band. The album follows with a lovely, laid-back take on "Rainy Night in Georgia," a cut custom made for the band''s trademark, low-key, country-flavored arrangements. It''s easy to compare the band to the Cowboy Junkies because like the Junkies, Hem takes things nice and easy; both bands are also fronted by female leads with compelling voices. Hem''s sound, however, is much more folk-country, more steel than electric guitar, than the Junkies, and Ellyson''s tone is lighter, more ethereal, than Margo Timmins''. The best stuff on No Word From Tom is great, and includes a version of Fountains of Wayne''s "Radiation Vibe," "The Present," and R.E.M.''s "So. Central Rain." The last cut, in particular, injects an emotional depth into the lyric that digs deeper than the original (plus one can actually hear the lyrics here). Hem has an appealing talent for completely re-imaging these songs in their own style. There are other things to like on this collection, including straight takes on country classics like "Crazy Arms" and "Tennessee Waltz," though the album runs thin in places. Demos and live cuts, as No Word From Tom progresses, begin to sound like filler. For this reason, the recording will probably not take on the classic status of Hem''s previous albums. Nonetheless, the good stuff here is so much better than what passes for alternative country and progressive folk, making No Word From Tom a worthy stopgap in the band''s history.', '2006-02-07 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-31 14:10:54', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1308, 8975, 'Rabbit Songs', 'Quoted as wanting to make a record "we could love the rest of our lives," Hem spent a year on this collection. The idea was to combine their love of traditional American music with the lushness of the occasional 18-piece orchestra, a good choice considering the sweet, crystalline quality of the vocal work by lead singer Sally Ellyson. Ellyson had never sung professionally before, but answered an ad in The Village Voice with a cassette of lullabies she''d recorded for a friend''s child, and the set begins with a snippet of what was on that tape -- a few lines unaccompanied from the traditional "Lord, Blow the Moon Out Please." Her voice, untarnished, as it may have been by spending nights on end singing in smoky bars, was worth waiting for. Rabbit Songs'' sound is lyrical, melodic, and pure. It was recorded in the old-fashioned, non-digital manner and that devotion to tradition is apparent in each song, whether in simple and sparse arrangements or full of strings and glockenspiel. The songs, which speak of devotion, loss, and voyeurism, don''t try to sound old -- they just have an effortlessly timeless appeal. "Betting on Trains," with its simple ebb and flow, is particularly lovely; "When I Was Drinking" speaks knowingly of disappointment, the effects of which are punctuated by swirling pedal steel; and "Horsey" swoons along to the old-time violin work of Carol Sharar like a relic from the past.

(1309, 8979, 'Call The Abumlance (Before I Hurt Myself)', 'Hilt wisely never pretended to be a radical break from the material with which Skinny Puppy made its name -- not only do all the core musicians and producers from that group appear here, but longtime art designer Steven R. Gilmore created the cover collages. Given that the music uses much the same heavy-duty percussion and structured, electronic approach, the major change lies with Nelson, a fine if not completely individual singer. On the one hand, he perhaps too openly uses some of Ogre''s familiar vocal tracks -- electronically slurred vocals, an air of threat -- which inevitably just makes the listener think of Ogre himself and his own obsessive, focused musical approach. On the other hand, Nelson''s lyrical material generally steers away from environmental horror show collapse and embraces a more personal and punked-up aesthetic. The musicians equally take numerous similar dives into the "loud fast rules" approach to create a reasonable impression of a hardcore band just coming to grips with technology, as songs like "Down on Mommy''s Farm," "Back to Insanity," and "Septic" demonstrate. At their least interesting, such material sounds like the Ministry knockoffs that cluttered up Skinny Puppy''s Rabies, but at other points the band lets the music breathe and even throws in reasonably kick-ass guitar jams, of all things. When Nelson takes a smoother but still direct approach, the results are among the album''s best, with the rest of the band working to suit that delivery instead of overwhelming it. "Baby Fly Away" is a wonderfully catchy number, heavy on the drums but otherwise an inspired slice of dreamy new wave pop with a killer chorus, while the lounge/croon/feedback combination "Come Alive" shouldn''t work but somehow does. Call the Ambulance is ultimately derivative, but it''s still an enjoyable variation on a sound, much like related project the Tear Garden.', '1987-12-01 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-31 15:23:32', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The idea behind it is great, mixing punk rock with Elton John-style piano rock. And for the most part, the music is the strongest part of the album. But it is Mark Critchley''s voice that does the most damage to the quality of the project. "More Gimmicks" and "No Life" are both good anti-establishment anthems that are tanked by his tight-throated vocals. He doesn''t quite sing, he just talks in tune to the music. Only on a few songs, like the beautiful "Photosynthesis" and the aforementioned rock opera "Open Letter to Dr. Strange," do the music and the vocals really come together. The album is a noble effort, but should probably be avoided by anyone who isn''t really dedicated to the idea that piano and punk should meet.', '1992-12-01 00:00:00', 0, 1, 9, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-31 15:51:03', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The ten-song set shines with smooth synth beats, breezy acoustic guitars, and elegant string arrangements. It''s refined and focused, but also sexy and intimate. The band''s airy softness turns dark, and it''s an inviting listen. Dominique Durand''s honeyed, warm vocals are as seductive as ever, especially on skin-tight tracks such as "Four in the Morning" and "Keep Moving." "Tess Don''t Tell" is classic Ivy. Andy Chase''s post-punk-influenced background fits Adam Schlesinger''s pop roots so nicely on this track, and it''s playful in mood without going overboard. Ivy didn''t overdo things in the studio. It''s an album that breathes easy while also one that struts in slow motion. The dreamy, piano-laden opener, "Nothing But the Sky," is testament to that. Slow-building pastel-colored melodies mixed between cool, chilled rock moments capture the essence of In the Clear.

(1312, 8982, 'Long Distance', 'Long Distance adds some production tricks and subtle electronic flourishes to the polished pop Ivy perfected on Apartment Life but forgets the hooks and melodies that made their second album so delightful. Unfortunately, Long Distance''s airy songs breeze past without many distinguishing characteristics. The album''s slick synths and trip-hop beats are dated -- even trip-popsters like Morcheeba and Sneaker Pimps abandoned this sound years ago. "Lucy Doesn''t Love You"''s sassy brass and lilting melody suggest a more satisfying song than it delivers, but the glossy, busy production smothers songs like "One More Last Kiss" and the seductive, bossa nova-tinged "Let''s Stay Inside"; both need a more intimate approach. However, a handful of songs display some spirit and personality: "Disappointed"''s taut rhythm and slinky guitars provide a sleekly sexy backdrop for Dominique Durand''s wistful vocals, and the shock of hearing some distorted guitars on "Blame it on Yourself" makes it memorable for that reason alone. Covering the Blow Monkeys'' "Digging Your Scene" might have been an ironic move, but it''s a highlight, due to its superior songwriting. Though "While We''re in Love"''s poignant trip-hop actually works, the blasé, lovelorn lyrics -- "We know it won''t last forever/Because we''re not meant to be together" -- sound tired. Long Distance''s successful moments make its well-groomed monotony especially frustrating: Ivy polished these songs to a fare-thee-well and invited guests like James Iha and Eric Matthews to play on them, yet they couldn''t give them more individuality or emotion. Ultimately, it''s a "tasteful" album: vaguely hip background music for coffeehouses, soundtracks, and anyone else looking for a veneer of coolness. No one''s asking Ivy to play lo-fi noise-rock, but Long Distance indicates that they''re satisfied with trendy prettiness instead of looking for lasting beauty.', '2001-07-10 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-31 16:22:37', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Other changes contributed, too. After 12 years, the band fulfilled its contract with Essential Records and parted ways, immediately setting up shop as an indie act under the Nettwerk umbrella. Frontman Dan Haseltine reported that the band had wanted to do a Christmas album ever since 1995''s four-song EP Little Drummer Boy, but label execs kept it from materializing. The only limit to their creativity now, it seemed, was deciding how deeply to reach into the repertoire of traditional holiday music and how much original material to infuse.

Instead of the Beach Boys-inspired harmonies and sugary electric guitars of Around the Year With Joe, Marc''s Brother, Daydreams finds Pisapia exploring his introspective side. Exhibiting a more gentle sound which incorporates touches of jazz and folk, Daydreams is a quiet collection of tracks that are equal parts Hoagy Carmichael and Elliott Smith. The result is a quiet, personal offering that captures a timeless quality by using an eclectic blend of instrumentation and simple, poetic lyricism. The tracks are laden with Pisapia''s consistently impressive acoustic guitar work, which enhances the songs without overwhelming them. Pisapia also proves himself to be an adept banjo player, and indeed the banjo is prominently featured throughout the record, notably on the playfully endearing "River Song." Strings and organ add to the mix, in addition to the percussion (handled by bandmate and sibling Marc Pisapia). Joe Pisapia has made his solo debut for all the right reasons; not to prove he can do it on his own, or to release an experimental work that may be rejected by fans of his band, but because he found himself with a bunch of great material that didn''t fit within the framework of Joe, Marc''s Brother. Fortunately, while another equally busy artist may have let the songs languish in a notebook or as home demos without ever being made available to the public, Pisapia was industrious enough to record and release them.', '2002-01-01 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-05 14:59:00', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1325, 9099, 'Country Mouse, City House', 'Like a baseball player who quietly hits 30 home runs every year or a golfer who regularly finishes in the Top Ten, Josh Rouse''s continued streak of excellence is easy to ignore and maybe even downplay a little. Beginning with 2003''s 1972, he''s been cranking out sweet and sophisticated albums influenced by his love of soft rock and filled with lyrical gems, smooth performances and his wonderfully rich and intimate vocals, and Country Mouse City House is no different. Again recorded in his new home country of Spain, this time out Rouse handles the production himself and proves that he learned quite a bit from his former partner Brad Jones as the album is just as lushly layered and as filled with aural candy (like the funky clavinet on "Hollywood Bass Player" or the horns that bolster "God, Please Let Me Go Back") as on the last three albums. The songs on Country are a nice mix of the last three albums, too; some have the lazy, relaxed feel of Subtitulo ("Snowy Night," "Pilgrim"), some have the indie pop glow of Nashville ("God, Please Let Me Go Back," "Sweetie") some have the soft rock groove of 1972 "(Italian Dry Ice," "Hollywood Bass Player"). Whatever it is, the sound they all have in common is Rouse''s first-rate songcraft, and there are few modern singer/songwriters who can approach him. While Country Mouse City House isn''t a towering home run, it is a stand-up double that drives in a couple runs, and that''s often what it takes to win games.', '2007-07-30 00:00:00', 0, 1, 4, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-05 15:52:49', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1332, 9124, 'Resurrection', 'The title of Swedish quintet Kamera''s debut album, Resurrection, reflects their battle for respect and stardom -- but it also reflects their love of the musical past, as they lovingly resurrect the sounds of the ''70s and ''80s across 11 pop-flecked tracks. Careful sequencing helps conceal just how eclectic Kamera really are, as they glide from post-punk to synth pop to the lavish stylings of the new romantics, paying tribute to a host of their heroes along the way. "Lies," slated as the first single, opens the set with a roar of droning guitars and pounding beats à la the Sisters of Mercy, who are covered in bubblegum by the time the band reaches the hook-laden chorus. But the band''s true love is synth-rinsed bands, with Duran Duran and Depeche Mode both inspiring the lush "Love Surrounds Us," the latter group and Soft Cell echoing across the bopping "I Was Made," and the Pet Shop Boys receiving their due on the fabulously infectious "Fragile." The inspired "TV Lights" rips its funky bassline from Duran, its four-on-the-floor beats from the discos, and its angular guitar from the post-punk scene. That number is irrepressible and "I Lost Control" is unquenchable, sucking up every early-''80s musical signature sound along the way. With instantly singalong melodies, dance-fired rhythms, and English lyrics, Kamera have it all, even the requisite ballad -- the haunting "Another Sign of Love," which closes the set.', '2007-08-28 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-06 11:43:26', '2015-02-16 15:47:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
