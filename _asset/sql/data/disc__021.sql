(1338, 9132, 'Kinky', 'Kinky may be a Mexican band, but these guys are a long shot from any preconceived notions you may have about what a Mexican band should sound like. They''re anything but traditional and, if tagged as anything, are about as alternative as Latin alternative gets. This is because Kinky is a band that plays electronic dance music without going the computerized beat-making route. Well, at least not wholeheartedly, as they retain their essence as a band above all (rather than program beats, they seem to sample themselves and then loop those samples). It''s tough to pin these guys down on their self-titled debut album because it veers all over the place, sometimes within a single song. The album opener, "Más," is a case in point, with its wah-wah guitars spitting out funk licks and its hip-hop breakbeats signifying the multicultural mélange to come. Some songs go a step further, like "Ejercico No. 16" in particular, kicking up such a dance-party dust storm that you''re liable to mistake Kinky for Daft Punk. So while Kinky are indeed Latin musicians and sing in Spanish, that''s somewhat of a minor issue. Like los Amigos Invisibles or Titan, Kinky emphasize the music, not the singing nor the cultural cues -- they''re a universal band with a universal sound that just happens to originate in Monterrey, Mexico. After all, this debut album was licensed by Nettwerk America (a Canadian label best known for releasing albums by Sarah McLachlan and the Barenaked Ladies) and was produced by Chris Allison (a Brit best known for working with Coldplay and Dot Allison), so it doesn''t exactly boast a lot of Latin credentials. It doesn''t need to when it''s this great -- Kinky is the sort of album that should stand on its out, beyond the realm of geographic or demographic categorization, and most certainly beyond cultural expectations or stereotypes. And when taken on its own terms -- an album of music performed by a band -- it''s hard to resist the dynamic rocktronica en español of Kinky here, especially if you''re keen on pigeonhole-defying multicultural listening experiences.', '2002-03-26 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-06 15:03:23', '2015-02-16 15:47:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(1339, 9132, 'Reina', 'In the same vein as their previous work, Kinky''s third record, Reina, combines elements of electronica, rock, and Latin into 40 minutes of hip-shaking music, which has always been what the band has done, anyway. So while the feel of each song may change somewhat between individual tracks ("I Say Hey" is Talking Headsy, "Lay Back" alludes to old-school hip-hop, and "¿Donde Van los Muertos?" uses a ranchera-inspired accordion), the overall intent and focus of the album is on the beat, and even in those moments where things start to become kind of cheesy (as music in which the synthesizer plays a large role, as it does here, is wont to do), the groove is so tight and crisp that it''s easy to ignore those missteps and think instead about showing off your moves. That last statement is clearly the objective of Kinky, too, because more than anything else, it sounds like they''re having a lot of fun, dancing around the studio as they play their instruments. The bass and guitar are clean and funky, the drums are equally as comfortable playing complex Latin beats (on the fantastic "Uruapan Breaks," for instance) as they are a more straightforward rock rhythm, the keyboards are poppy and quirky, the effects are well placed (the roaring sample in "León," for instance), and singer Gilberto Cerezo''s voice is light and airy, a kind of José González-meets-Rob B-from-Stereo MC''s (a comparison helped by the fact he often doubles up his vocal tracks), and works as a nice complement to the band''s super-produced sound (as does the voice of Men at Work''s Colin Hay, who adds his to the sleaze-groove of "Monday Killer"). It''s all layered together, looped and twisted, and spread out into 12 easily digestible yet complex and interesting songs, catchy in that fun, plasticy kind of way, meant to be enjoyed and danced to during the summer months and then placed gently aside when the first frost starts to set in, where they''ll wait patiently for next spring, when the party can start up all over again.', '2006-09-05 00:00:00', 0, 1, 7, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-06 15:18:42', '2015-02-16 15:47:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Upon her return, she got to work on The Living Road, an album about travel, whether it be wheels upon the road, or through life itself. It''s hard to say whether the experience of life on the road was the catalyst for the broadening of the writing this time out; there are songs in Spanish, French, and English this time out, but all three are languages that Lhasa was immersed in beforehand. Musically, it''s a natural follow-up to La Llorona, drawing from many of the same traditional styles and blending them with more modern instrumentation into a very seamless, sophisticated, and sensual mélange, one that thankfully never tips over into the pretentious, condescending, or hokey.

Her voice is friendly, her guitars are warm, her lyrics are sweet and honest: she''s the perfect pop package. With her self-titled debut, which came out in 2002, the tail end of the movement, it can be understood why so many of these attributes were present, and it was fine. But with the release of her follow-up album, 1-800-Bankrupt, four years later, things seem a little dated. Not that there should be any obligation to follow contemporary trends, but everything that O''Neil''s doing here just seems like, well, it''s already been done hundreds of times before. And while the singer doesn''t do a worse job than any of her predecessors, she doesn''t do a better job or bring anything new, either. Jill Sobule, O''Neil''s co-producer and co-songwriter, leaves her indelible mark on the record with proper-noun-driven lyrics that talk mainly of lost love. But while Sobule, in her own music, comes across as quirky and introspective, O''Neil just seems cheesy and consumed by her broken heart. Most of her words have all been said before ("Why don''t you stay?/It''s just one day" or "Everything''s a shade of gray/Since you''ve been away") and her melodies, while comforting, are boring and absolutely predictable. It''s made-for-radio pop that no radio is playing. O''Neil has had some great inspiration and influences leading up to her own work, much of which is heard in 1-800-Bankrupt -- "Why Don''t You Visit" hints at Joni Mitchell and "You''ll Be Sorry" is practically an homage to Aimee Mann -- but they only manage to remind listeners of what other artists can do, not of what O''Neil herself is capable. There''s nothing wrong with 1-800-Bankrupt -- despite the insensibly campy lyrics, the short repeated choruses, the lullaby-pop harmonies -- but there''s nothing right with it, either.

Sometimes it''s plain goofy, such as with Fussible''s "Tijuana Makes Me Happy," with its silly English lyric, and sometimes it triggers odd associations -- Bostich''s "Tengo la Voz" brings to mind Herb Alpert with its trumpet rather than anything more rooted. It''s notable that this time around, rather than appearing on the major Palm Pictures, it''s on the Mexican-based Nacional label, a good home for this music, which overall succeeds in offering the listener 21st century Tijuana. Not everything is good -- Clorofila''s "Almada" seems to get stuck in a monotonous groove, for example -- but some are superb. On "Colorado" Fussible seem to channel the spirit of Talking Heads, while "Narcoteque" from Clorofila and Calexico brings Brian Eno to mind. So, like any compilation, it''s a mixed bag.

(1405, 9278, 'Oh Susanna', 'It''s an old trek what is called roots music these days to something closer to rock, and Suzie Ungerleider, aka Oh Susanna, makes it on her eponymous album. Rock is, of course, a relative concept, and on this album it''s the Americana variation, low on tech but rich in feeling. (The only keyboard on the album is acoustic or electric piano; even a B-3 is apparently too slick for this mix.) But there''s greasy slide and pounding drums on tracks like "Right by Your Side," with down-home horns that add up to a Band feel over a toned-down Stones groove. The I-VII-IV chord change coming out of the verse on "Mama" also has a Stones quality, and the vocal line on "Mama" echoes "Angie" a bit, but the feel here also draws from Uncle Tupelo and more contemporary variations. Ungerleider''s lyrics address love in language that can be blunt "Little White Lies" or coquettish "Carrie Lee," with a delivery that brings out the poetry in even the most prosaic lines; on "Down by the Quarry" she achieves an especially vivid synthesis of all these elements, with swampy fiddles and rawboned harmony helping to bring the scent of backwoods romance to life. At an opposite extreme, the distant, dreamlike electric guitar on "Zoe," a peek into a child''s moment of epiphany, recalls some of Patty Griffin''s best work. (In fact, by closing with the reflective vocal/piano piece "Billy," Oh Susanna follows the same closing dynamic as Flaming Red.) The album comes as well with a 9/11 eulogy, though "Cain Is Rising" darkens its indignation by targeting equally the Twin Towers bad guys and the politicians who "say it''s time to fight this little war" after ignoring more endemic social ailments; it''s a more subversive message than even that of "John Walker''s Blues." For all these comparisons, though, Oh Susanna really is about the emergence of a distinctive artist, whose antecedents are clear and yet whose future seems assured.

(1406, 9279, 'Big Iron World', 'Similar to their first album, Big Iron World sees Old Crow Medicine Show draw upon the spirit of old-timey American string band music, adding a surprisingly refreshing and youthful flair that breathes new life into what''s traditional as well as harnessing a sound of their own. The group once again teamed up with David Rawlings who produced and performed on the album, co-writing five of its 12 songs. Rawlings musical other half, Gillian Welch also appears here, trading in her guitar and signature vocals for a pair of drum sticks. The first single from Big Iron Worldis an upright bass and harmonica-heavy, moaning ballad called "Down Home Girl" -- written by Arthur Butler and Jerry Leiber (the latter being responsible for such hits as "Yakety Yak," "Hound Dog," and "Jailhouse Rock"). Of course, Old Crow Medicine Show makes the tune their own, with slide guitar and Willie Watson''s nasally mountain-style vocals, accentuated perfectly by the close harmony range of his bandmates. Big Iron World is a flourishing a mixture of backwoods crooners, bluegrass-tinged rockers, and crooning backwoods bluegrass-tinged rockers. There''s the Highway 61 Revisited-era Dylanesque "Bobcat Tracks" and the jumping "James River Blues" both with irresistible fiddle breakdowns and perfectly executed vocal harmonies. Just as the songs "CC Rider" and "Poor Man" from Old Crow Medicine Show''s debut showcased their unique vocal abilities, here they exhibit an ability to kidnap their listeners from the hustle and bustle of modern life and take them back to the good old days that neither they, nor the band, were born early enough to know. Big Iron World has its fair share of songs that offer bleak and bittersweet atmospheres. The ominous yet weary "Don''t Ride That Horse," and the spiritually reverent "God''s Got It," could carry themselves even if they were sung a cappella. The album''s overall rainy autumn day feel isn''t without its upbeat moments and humor, though. "Cocaine Habit," much like the debut album''s "Tell It to Me," is a catchy harmonica-driven ode to cocaine abuse. It''s followed by the rollicking "Minglewood Blues" which shows the genius achieved from melding bluegrass and blues -- not to mention the genius of Watson''s distinctive howl that sets it apart. What it proves is that Big Iron World is no less worthy of praise than their debut,and furthers the band''s position as one of the better neo-traditionalist string bands of the early years of the 2000s.', '2006-08-29 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-12 01:47:56', '2015-02-16 15:47:03', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The group had toured with some of the finest names in bluegrass and folk music, and was well on its way to becoming a household name for fans of both genres. After the success of the group''s first album, OCMS teamed up with David Rawlings (creative partner of Gillian Welch) and began work on the group''s second album, Down Home Girl. A three-song EP was released in July, a month before the scheduled arrival of the full-length album Big Iron World. The EP includes the title track, an upright bass and harmonica-heavy, moaning ballad called "Down Home Girl"; as well as the rousing and nostalgic "James River Blues" -- both to appear on the August LP. The final track on the EP is a raucous, rollicking bluegrass track, "Fall on My Knees," an exclusive bonus apart from the upcoming album. If the EP is any prediction to as to what will appear on Big Iron World, OCMS hasn''t even begun to see the extent of its esteem. Down Home Girl introduces a more well-rounded, confident and talented OCMS, with a more dynamic and upbeat sound.

(1408, 9279, 'OCMS', 'Old Crow Medicine Show is an all-acoustic quintet from four states whose members met in New York City and currently reside in Nash Vegas. Their storied beginnings include a North American cross-continent ramble while they learned their instruments and how to play together, eventually ending up playing on the street in front of the Grand Ole Opry before being asked to the stage some weeks later. Their self-titled debut album is equal parts Woody Guthrie''s dust bowl weariness and Cisco Houston''s rambling code of the road, Phil Ochs'' view of a passing America, the Kingston Trio''s wide-eyed enthusiastic earnestness, the New Christy Minstrels'' sense of community, Doc and Merle Watson''s home-grown blues as informed by Bill Monroe, Beat Generation lamentations, forlorn 1960s idealism, and the musical mindset that fueled America''s original folk revival from the 1950s as it moved toward rockabilly. In other words, this record is informed by ghosts but executed in flesh, blood, sweat, and laughter. Whether the tunes are covers from antiquity ("CC Rider," "Poor Man," "Tell It to Me") or originals by fiddler and vocalist Ketch Secor and his songwriting and singing partner, Willie Watson ("Trials & Troubles," "Hard to Tell," "We''re in This Together"), the feel is the same: passion, humor, and relentless drive to get to the heart of the tune and put it across. There is so much enthusiasm here, so much willingness and fire, that it would be hard to do anything but want to sing along.

(1416, 9287, 'Home To You', 'By their third release it had already been noted numerous times that beautiful harmonies were a strong point for alternative folksters Po'' Girl and that they could entrance with music that wasn''t afraid to straddle genres while remaining organically pure. With their third release. Canada''s acoustic wonders have conquered the full-length, conceptual album, something that didn''t seem important before when experiencing the group song by song was the thing. Home to You is a thematically sound effort focusing on what "home" means in a day and age where jobs, school, relationships, and a million other things send people miles and miles away from where they were born. Some songs are direct, some are so metaphorical that they seem to have strayed from the "home" theme until more closely inspected, but whatever direction they come from, they succeed. While the band still relies quite a bit on "feel" -- mixing coffee shop, front porch, and old-timey nostalgia music into their own unique blend -- their ability to write poignant lyrics has become just as strong. Allison Russell''s "To the Angry Evangelist" is the ideal example of this growth as the singer paints religion as a suppressing force and rallies against the earthbound struggle/joyful afterlife dichotomy, declaring she wants her joy in this life. It''s also the song where Po'' Girl feel most like a group as the four musicians simmer in slow motion beneath the venomous words before exiting in a frantic cacophony that used to be exclusive territory for electric rock bands. The rest of the album finds the group sounding more like a songwriter''s circle than they ever have with everyone getting their turn on the mic and using an abundance of "I"''s when they get there. "I" dominates the album, the "you"''s are mostly betrayers and loves lost, and it takes 12 tracks to get to the word "we," although the "we" in "Texas" is in the past tense, with "You were thinking of her/I was thinking of him"; it was doomed from the beginning. You can read up on their history and find that it''s no big surprise these four vagabonds have an iffy relationship with home, but they seem to admire the traditional elements of the concept and often pine for more of a connection to it. How well the listener can relate to this bittersweet relationship will decide how deep the album sinks in, but there''s no denying Home to You is a layered, insightful, and achingly poignant triumph that still works even if you just want to hear the pretty music.

(1417, 9287, 'Vagabond Lullabies', 'What separates Po'' Girl from so many other folky groups with multiple singers is that no matter how sweet their voices are, what really stands out is the mesmerizing groove. They''re fine songwriters, too, but that''s not what first hits you. It''s the lazy sway of Po'' Girl''s music, a hypnotic and humid sway that''s hard to resist. The album''s title, Vagabond Lullabies, is probably a better description but it doesn''t touch on the Southern feel of the record, a record that comes from someplace anywhere but Southern: Vancouver, Canada. The porches in Vancouver must be wonderful places to play music, since there is a genuine smile that comes through Po'' Girl''s music, and despite all the wandering, the tunes always come home in the end. There''s a druggy muddiness too, making who does what less obvious and Po'' Girl a very cohesive unit. Allison Russell is the breathier one while Trish Klein is the more brassy vocalist, and they complement each other wonderfully. On first listen, the album enchants beginning to end. On second listen, some of the songs separate themselves as great highlights, Russell''s rustic rave-up "Movin'' On" being the best. Sneaky raps and beatboxing from guest CR Avery give the album an approachable sense of fun, and the revolving instrumentation keeps things interesting. Add a well-structured running order for the tracks and you''ve got an intimate, smooth, and dreamy album to waste away a sunny afternoon.', '2004-09-21 00:00:00', 0, 1, 5, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-01-12 12:05:10', '2015-02-16 15:47:03', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
