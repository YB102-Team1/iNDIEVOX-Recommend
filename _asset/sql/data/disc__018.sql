Joined by the remaining members of her accomplished Sparrow Quartet -- banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck, cellist Ben Sollee, and fiddle player Casey Driessen -- Washburn served as a sort of artistic ambassador to the region, introducing Tibetan audiences to American music while absorbing Asian influences at the same time. This resulting album bridges the gap between those traditions, offering up an unorthodox brand of folk music that combines the old-timey strains of Uncle Earl (Washburn''s previous group) with Eastern scales, Chinese lyrics, and a double-scoop of twangy banjo. It''s a record that will seem vaguely foreign to any listener, but the Sparrow Quartet seems to thrive on those eccentricities, as some of the group''s strongest performances coincide with the oddest musical pairings. The bandmates draw inspiration from Chinese folk ("Taiyang Chulai"), American gospel ("Captain"), vintage string bands ("Banjo Pickin'' Girl"), field recordings, and Kazakh melodies, with the banjo interplay of Washburn and Fleck stitching the entire mixture together. Washburn''s vocals are confident and airily soulful, but it''s the music that truly stands out here, as the four musicians know when to tone down their virtuosity and simply play with each other.

Four years later, she made a typically subdued return with Afterglow, her first album in six years. Not much has changed in the time she was away. Afterglow is firmly within the McLachlan signature sound — a softly tuneful, mildly atmospheric blend of classic singer/songwriterism and a touch of vaguely dreamy alternative pop, all shined and immaculately produced by Pierre Marchand. Prior to its release, the album was touted as the first collection of songs she wrote entirely on piano, not guitar, but ultimately this doesn''t make much of a difference to the overall feel and effect of the album, which perfectly dovetails with Surfacing. At times, the pacing is so languid and the production so open-ended, the album kind of drifts away, but it''s not only in a pleasant fashion; it''s also no different than its immediate predecessor, which also could meander. In other words, after a prolonged absence, Sarah McLachlan re-emerges with a record that could have followed Surfacing by six months, not years.

He trashes the hopeful chording of the original nearly completely, instead floating Sarah McLachlan''s vocals over a taut guitar line for an addictive mixture of tension and atmosphere. Book it: this track will resurface as the setup music for a wirework shootout in some Matrix-style film of the very near future. Unfortunately the set is flawed from there on out. It has some good ideas but often doesn''t develop them, and takes the generic trance route much too willingly. It''s true that McLachlan''s breathy, warmly ethereal style is a great overlay for trance and progressive house productions. But some of Bloom''s remixers rely on the broadest of stylistic clichés in their application of her voice. "Vox," a track from McLachlan''s 1989 debut, Touch, is an interesting choice for Bloom. But Tom Middleton wastes it with a bouncing mechanistic template that''s so transparent it might as well be DJ Sammy. Hyper doesn''t fare any better with the Afterglow track "Stupid," and former hit single "Fallen" is robbed of its homespun grace by Gabriel & Dresden. A bit of the song''s melody remains, but it''s stretched like an overworked twist-tie across canned percussive ticks and the stale warble of pulsing trance synths. Unlike XL''s take on "Fire," these tracks rob McLachlan of her vitality, reducing her to a faceless trance diva. There''s a similar problem with will.i.am''s "Just Like Me," where McLachlan is the disembodied chorus voice for what''s essentially a passably entertaining Black Eyed Peas song. (The Harry Chapin-copped chorus goes nowhere, and DMC is a non-factor.) Fortunately Bloom has some highlights. Sly & Robbie come through with their take on "Train Wreck," keeping the original''s pace but adding bright keyboard stabs and a burbling bassline for a subtle pop/R&B feel. Junior Boys'' "Fumbling Toward Ecstasy" also builds a promising, vaguely threatening sort of atmosphere, similar to the feel McLachlan gave some of the tracks on that record, and Talvin Singh adds tasteful tabla drums and sitars to the gentle "Answer." Ultimately Bloom is about as adventurous as its artwork, which by not featuring McLachlan herself suggests the average forgettable trance or downtempo comp. But at least it has its moments, and completist fans will probably want these remixes in their collections.', '2005-09-06 00:00:00', 0, 1, 4, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-16 14:25:28', '2015-02-16 15:46:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1155, 8469, 'Mirrorball - The Complete Concert (Legacy Edition)', 'Sarah McLachlan''s 1999 Mirrorball, her first ever live album, showed off the singer in the prime of career, when her popularity both as an artist and as the organizer of Lilith Fair had made her a star. And while that record was good, and exposed the talents of McLachlan''s powerful, clear voice and the strength of her band, it generally stuck to her most famous songs, especially those off her then most recent album, Surfacing. That same year, however, a DVD of the last shows on her concert tour (in Portland, OR, on April 20 and 21, 1998), Mirrorball, also came out, and it featured the singer''s entire set list -- which pulled from all four of the albums she had out -- as well as her conversations with the audience and her between-sing banter. Mirrorball: The Complete Concert, released in 2006, includes the audio tracks from that show, banter (even more banter, in fact) included. McLachlan sounds impeccable throughout the entire album, her voice sliding easily from its higher range in "Path of Thorns" to something softer in "Do What You Have to Do" to the near wailing in the extended version of the song that first brought her to fame in the U.S., "Possession." Her band, too, whom she introduces on the second disc, is tight and professional, adding enough of their own instrumental prowess to make the performance something different than what would be heard on the studio-recorded discs. In fact, the live versions of "Plenty" and "Ice," with their additional vocal harmonies, are superior to the originals, which if nothing else attests to the abilities of McLachlan and everyone with whom she surrounded herself. The majority of the material covered comes from Surfacing and Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, especially the latter -- all tracks but "Circle" are included -- but she also dips back into Solace for "The Path of Thorns," a rousing version of "Into the Fire," and "I Will Not Forget You" (which is not to be confused with "I Will Remember You," also performed here) and even to her debut, Touch, with "Vox." It''s a strong set, presenting the best of what chick-rock was in the late ''90s: emotional, introspective music that could kick in both a distorted electric guitar and a soft piano with equal facility. By 2006, McLachlan had sunk into adult contemporary obscurity/notoriety, but Mirrorball: The Complete Concert shows her at her best, a nice reminder of what she once was, and why she had so many devoted fans.', '2006-09-26 00:00:00', 0, 1, 4, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-16 15:12:27', '2015-02-16 15:46:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Only 19 at the time, McLachlan had years to go before she would become the seductive songstress of Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or the sensitive balladeer of Surfacing. Instead, she has more of an ethereal sound, enhanced by keyboards and a lush production that gives it a polished feel. Bringing to mind the ''80s incarnations of both Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, the songs here are moody pop tracks that showcase her incredible range more than anything else. A few tracks, especially "Vox" and "Steaming," are beautiful tracks that have a light sense of yearning that she would later develop into the sensual crooning of her mid-''90s work. And "Ben''s Song," a piano ballad, would go on to be included in her live shows long after the other tracks from this album disappeared from them. But Touch is vastly different from the rest of her material (save for maybe a few tracks on Solace), making it a surprise to most curious fans. Her performance is the point where this is most obvious, as her gorgeous voice lacks most of the personality and emotion that she would later develop. But the material isn''t bad, just uncharacteristic of the rest of her career. Some fans might be disappointed by the copious amounts of keyboards and McLachlan''s restrained performance, but Touch is still a winner.

(1163, 8469, 'Wintersong', 'Because no artist''s career is truly complete without a holiday album, Sarah McLachlan took yet another step toward establishing her place in sentimental adult contemporary radio history with Wintersong. For the most part, the singer chooses the darker, more melancholic, and "wintry" pieces to cover (there''s no "Joy to the World" or "Angels We Have Heard on High," for example), focusing as much on the Christmas season and the general feel of the holiday as on its religious connotations. She brings together the folk spiritual "Mary Mary" -- also called "Virgin Mary" when covered by Joan Baez on her 1966 Noël or "Mary What You Gonna Call That Pretty Little Baby" when a black gospel song -- and the traditional "The First Noel," showing off not only her own impressive range but her ability to adapt to different vocal styles while still remaining wholly herself. Her version of Gordon Lightfoot''s "Song for a Winter''s Night," which was originally released on the 1994 Miracle on 34th Street soundtrack (and then on McLachlan''s Rarities, B-Sides & Other Stuff), is pretty and sweet, using as acoustic guitar as well as layers and layers of vocal harmonies to create a sense of space and warmth, and her cover of Joni Mitchell''s "River" is lovely, too, using a guitar and arpeggiated synths to push the song sadly along. The synths, in fact, are used frequently on Wintersong, sometimes in their string form on "O Little Town of Bethlehem" or "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," which works nicely, but more often as slightly new agey background effects that get a little tedious, especially considering the fact McLachlan has always been able to carry herself on more organic instrumentation, and sound good doing it, too. She does manage to just stick to only the sad, reflective piano chords on which she has earned her living -- nice in their simplicity -- on the title track, the one original song on the album, which sounds a lot, both thematically and musically, like "River," using Christmas as a way to contemplate a lover ("And this is how I see you/In the snow on Christmas morning..../Oh I miss you now, my love, merry Christmas," she sings). McLachlan''s voice sounds great, and her interpretations stick pretty close to the originals while still expressing her own artistic individuality (with the exception of "What Child Is This [Greensleeves]," in which she goes too far, taking liberties with the melody and changing the song too much); but in making everything so soft and ethereal, instead of increasing their poignancy (which is certainly a goal of hers), she kills some of the songs'' immediacy and power, unfortunately rendering Wintersong a little lifeless, albeit soothing, at the end.', '2006-10-17 00:00:00', 0, 1, 4, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-16 15:29:46', '2015-02-16 15:46:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

A surprising number of these 14 songs, like the opening "People to People," are straight-up reggae, with Urmston working to sound as much like Bunny Wailer as a white boy from Vermont can.

Then there''s a lot of stuff like "Man in the Hall," where the idea is to make jam band grooves for the trustafarians to noodle-dance to.

(1171, 8495, 'Year Of The Crow', 'State Radio''s sophomore effort shines its brightest when it leaves the jam band world behind, choosing instead to focus on raucous, semi-punky rhythms and left-wing social commentary. With song titles like "Guantanamo," "CIA," and "Fall of the American Empire," the bandmates make no attempt to hide their political agenda as they point a collective finger at the "torture advocates" and "crooked white chiefs" who run the country. The lyrics are often poignant, especially when they''re combined with the buzzing basslines and high-pitched, harmonized vocals that make "Guantanamo" such an effective leadoff track. "Rash of Robberies" follows a similar trajectory, mixing full-throttled rock-outs and urgent wordplay with slow, quieter passages. Chad Urmston pushes his voice to its upper limit, his lyrics clumping together in one sweaty mass as the band pulses beneath him. Here, Urmston''s messages of revolution and awareness are backed with equal enthusiasm from the group, and Year of the Crow glows as a result. But elsewhere, State Radio abandons that formula in order to focus on the band''s jam-happy past, which results in a number of white-boy reggae tunes and misguided attempts at funk. As was the case with Us Against the Crown, the band seems tempted to take up permanent residence in this cloudy hodgepodge of jam genres -- and, indeed, they stay mired in such material for a good portion of the disc, playing easygoing tunes that are guaranteed to make their stoned fans dance. The insightful lyrics remain, but they''re often cheapened by the light instrumentation and easy-to-remember mantras like "I will fight no more, forever" (which Urmston delivers in his best Jamaica-by-way-of-Vermont accent). That particular tune, "Fight No More," does have a nice ending, replete with a string section and some pretty harmonies. Even so, the band''s message gets lost during the aforementioned jam-heavy moments, due in large part to the number of Northeastern "reggae" bands that have attempted something similar -- that is, writing a song about revolution, backed with island rhythms and upbeat guitar stabs -- without knowing a darn thing about the topic at hand. State Radio is, after all, a Caucasian group from the jam band haven of Vermont, and while they do have a message to convey, they''d do better to set themselves apart by focusing on songs that are as volatile and urgent as the words Urmston writes.

Those stories sort of paralleled her real-life experience, which found the L.A.-based singer and songwriter dropped from Capitol soon after the album''s release. Four years on, she''s regrouped with her first effort for Nettwerk, entitled Lakeville. Named for her Massachusetts hometown, the album finds Correia more assured of her tasteful, easygoing sound, as well as her place in the world. Opener "59th Street" is gentle, with brushed percussion and slight touches of acoustic guitar and keyboard. The arrangement fits perfectly Correia''s memory of a failed romance, because this time around, instead of feeling sorry she just smiles and moves on. "The rain came down on 59th Street," she sings in her smiling, breezy voice, "And I didn''t mind at all." "California" is even more content. A tribute to the "brown hills and tiger lily thrills," the song''s also a thank-you in the way so many songs about California are -- it''s a savior state, a refuge, a place to believe in, and it''s been all of that to Correia. The clever wordplay and dreamy lilt of "Stranded" would place it comfortably among the work of young songsmiths like John Mayer and Jason Mraz, while "Beautiful/Ugly" is dusty and echoing, and has an after-hours cabaret quality with its mournful cello and faraway keys. Correia''s voice is made for songs like this, where her high register can tingle on the end notes and drawl the lower, sultrier ones. But Lakeville isn''t content to linger in the quiet -- remember, this album is all about contentment, and that means anything''s game. "Dollar Lake" is an upbeat, nearly honky tonk number with great, chattering acoustic guitar and a classic reverb effect on Correia''s vocal, and "The Devil and I" is a low-down blues-influenced cut tinged with rangy pedal steel and suggestive of fellow L.A. chanteuse Eleni Mandell. Correia takes on another, entirely different vocal persona for the track; her versatility throughout Lakeville continues to amaze, and proves the comfort level she must have had during the sessions. It''s an album that never acknowledges clichés, is incredibly patient with its instrumentation, and always makes Correia the star of the show. No longer lost, she''s learned how to shine with quiet effectiveness.', '2004-10-05 00:00:00', 0, 1, 4, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2008-12-18 14:25:49', '2015-02-16 15:46:56', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
