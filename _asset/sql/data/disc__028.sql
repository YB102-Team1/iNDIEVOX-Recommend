(1712, 10696, 'Concerto Suite For Electric Guitar And Orchestra In Flat Minor O', '一張電吉他與交響樂所共譜的經典樂章\r\nYngwie的交響大夢終於實現\r\n如果說Ritchie Blackmore(Deep Purple, Rainbow)是第一位將古典樂小調音階帶入重搖滾領域的電吉他手, 那麼Yngwie Malmsteen便是將它發揚光大的不二人選。由於瑞典出生的Yngwie生長在古典音樂薰陶的家庭之中, 巴哈, 帕格尼尼等音樂家都成了他的啟蒙恩師, 再加上Deep Purple, ELP, Genesis, Jimi Hendrix等搖滾界翹楚對他的影響, 不難想像他如今所呈現出的音樂風格與影響後輩所做的貢獻, 如果沒有Yngwie那有今日Symphony X, Stratovarius與Rhapsody等的新古典樂派呢?\r\nYngwie有一個夢想, 每個樂迷對他也同樣有這個期盼 ─ 何時才能實現電吉他的新古典速彈與交響樂團共奏的大夢? 1995年Yngwie的專輯 "Magnum Opus"發行後曾允諾要圓了這個夢, 然而在樂迷熱切期待之下卻隨即轉趨失望, 接下來的 "Inspiration"是對前輩的致敬翻唱作品, 這個食言之舉對他的傷害程度可想而知, 所幸流言終於被 "Concerto Suite...."所擊破, 一張不折不扣的交響樂與電吉他共鳴之作總算做了交代。\r\n由亞特蘭大交響樂團首席指揮Yoel Levi揮舞著指揮棒, 捷克愛樂管弦樂團的全力支援, Yngwie的neo-classical電吉他演奏可說是到了無與倫比的境界, 以組曲形式所譜成的12個樂章, 令人感受到無窮無盡的音樂生命力, 富麗堂皇的巴洛克色彩洋溢在每一個音符中, 電吉他所勾勒出的華美旋律也使人們的情感不知不覺地融入到這個世紀交響盛宴, 而這項傑作也勢必將留名於搖滾青史。 \r\n\r\n\r\nIn His Own Words . . . \r\n\r\n Yngwie Discusses his Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in Eb minor, Op. 1\r\n"Ever since I was born I have always been surrounded by music. My older brother and sister were both multi-instrumentalists playing piano, flute, violin, and drums. I received my first guitar on my fifth birthday but never took any formal guitar training. However, I had piano, cornet, flute, and drum lessons for a couple of years. In 1970 when I was seven, I saw Jimi Hendrix on Swedish television and began my lifelong love affair with the guitar. I picked up my guitar that very moment and played day in and day out like a boy possessed. On my eighth birthday I got my very first LP. It was Deep Purple''s Fireball. I loved the energy and power of that band. I joined a band when I was nine, which played mostly Purple and Hendrix cover songs, but slowly I started to write some of my own music. It actually got to a point when I knew all the Blackmore and Hendrix solos/songs that I started to wonder, is this it, what''s next?\r\n\r\n"During this time, my sister, Lollo, brought home a record by the band Genesis called Trespass. The arrangements, chordal structures, and counterpoint melodies intrigued me very much. They broke all the boundaries of the blues-based pentatonic realm. At first I wondered where all this came from but after analyzing my mother''s classical (mostly Baroque) record collection, I of course realized where it stemmed from. From that point on, my love for classical Baroque music was irreversible.\r\n\r\n"At the age of twelve, I carried on forming various bands where we performed strictly my compositions. The pieces were strongly Baroque-influenced heavy rock pieces. I still enjoyed the spirit and energy of "rock" music but felt frustrated with the run-of-the-mill melodic content (especially when it never seemed to go beyond the pentatonic) of the average rock band. Hence, I began losing interest in listening to rock.\r\n\r\n"At thirteen, I saw the violinist, Gideon Kremer, on (once again) Swedish television and was truly amazed at what I heard. He played Nicolo Paganini''s 24 Caprices, which I immediately bought at the record store. This was a very important revelation to me because that''s how my approach to guitar really changed forever. The long sustaining notes with a dramatic vibrato, the cascading descending and ascending lines and nearly impossible arpeggios became by far the greatest influence on my solo playing.\r\n\r\n"However, instead of studying the pieces per se, I always improvised in a somewhat similar vein. Obviously this was an arduous task and many years passed before I came close to reaching my goal. As I carried on my "neo-classical rock" journey, I started to dream that maybe one day I could compose and perform a piece in a somewhat orthodox classical form. I wanted to compose a piece for orchestra, choir (my mother sang in a Baroque choir), and guitar with myself as the soloist. No "rock" drums. No "rock" vocals.\r\n\r\n"After moving to the U.S. at age nineteen in 1983, my recording career took off like I''d never dreamed. This was very good I felt, simply because I insisted and got total musical freedom. That resulted in a number of heavily Baroque-influenced hard rock albums that did rather well. Although I was quite happy with the music I was making, there was always in the back of my head a vision of realizing that "classical" piece being composed by me and performed by a full orchestra and choir.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto: William Hames for YOUNG GUITAR\r\n\r\n"The opportunity did not come until 1996 for me to take some serious time out to compose such a piece. I know many classical numbers note for note, but I did not learn them from a piece of paper. I picked them up from listening carefully. I always play with my ears! Therefore, the way the Concerto Suite was assembled is quite unorthodox. Basically, I improvised until I felt a good theme or chord progression was developed. Luckily, I own a multitrack studio, which made it easy to record the demos. I''m even more fortunate to have in my band a great keyboard player, Mats Olausson, who spent countless hours in my studio working with me. I composed the piece and then had Mats translate the parts onto the keyboard. For example, I''d say, "Play this part with a cello sound." I would hum it or play it on guitar. Then we''d do the harpsichord, contrabass, violins, flute, trombone, oboe, timpani, choir, and so forth. This went on for about three months or so as I kept coming up with new ideas. Segments were revised or turned around; put together; keys were changed; main themes became secondary ones; new themes and melodies kept turning up; counterpoints were added and so on. Throughout all this madness, Mats stuck by me and for that I thank him deeply. When my composition was nearly complete, the next logical step was to score it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n"While I was recording one of my albums, Inspiration, and Mats was out of the country, I needed some keyboard parts done. My manager, Jim Lewis, recommended David Rosenthal. I had heard of him before, so I thought it was a good idea. He came to my studio and played great. We got along so well that I asked him if he wanted to hear my ideas for an orchestral piece. After playing it for him, he declared he was the man to transcribe it. He scored it out and recorded a synthesized version for which I re-recorded all of my guitar parts, and it worked out great.\r\n\r\n"Next step was to find a conductor and an orchestra. In the classical realm, it seems that most good conductors and orchestras are booked solid for years in advance. While on tour, I met Yoel Levi, the conductor of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He listened to the demo of the piece and was really impressed. He knew about my playing from his son and was very enthusiastic about the project.\r\n\r\n"In June 1997, I got on a plane and flew to the beautiful city of Prague to begin rehearsals and recording. Pony Canyon, my Japanese label, has a close relationship with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. After discussions with many other orchestras, we decided that the combination of the high quality players, concert hall, and recording facilities suited our needs the best.\r\n\r\nThe recording was a unique situation for myself, the orchestra, and engineers. It went great! After finishing the recording of the orchestra, we moved back to Miami to record the guitars and mix the album. The results exceeded my wildest expectations. My dream has come true."\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nYngwie Johann Malmsteen \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYoel Levi \r\nMusic Director\r\nThe Robert Reid Topping Music Director Chair\r\n\r\n Music Director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and frequent guest conductor of leading orchestras throughout North America, Europe and the Far East, Yoel Levi has transformed the Atlanta Symphony into a world-class orchestra noted for the clarity, virtuosity and sonic beauty of its playing. Hailing this metamorphosis under his baton, Gramophone magazine said, "Yoel Levi has built a reputation for himself and his orchestra that is increasingly the envy of his Big Five counterparts in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Boston and Chicago." With the orchestra and its award-winning chorus, he gave a highly successful performance of Mahler''s Symphony No. 2 ("Resurrection") in New York''s Avery Fisher Hall. In 1991 he led the orchestra in an extensive and critically-celebrated European tour encompassing 15 cities in six countries. In addition, the ASO was nominated "Best Orchestra of the Year" for 1991-92 by the first annual International Classical Music Awards (the Chicago Symphony being the only other American orchestra nominated for this prestigious honor). \r\nMr. Levi''s conducting engagements have included appearances with orchestras in London, Paris, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Rome, Frankfurt, Munich, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Israel and Japan. In North America he has conducted the New York Philharmonic and the orchestras of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Washington, Minnesota, Toronto and Montreal, among others. In 1991 he was invited to conduct the Stockholm Philharmonic in performance at the Nobel Prize ceremony. He has also led acclaimed performances of Mahler''s Ninth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic, Orff''s Carmina Burana and Mahler''s Eighth Symphony with the Cleveland Orchestra at the Blossom Festival, Britten''s War Requiem with the Detroit Symphony, and Mendelssohn''s Elijah with the San Francisco Symphony. In the fall of 1996 he was appointed as the first Music Advisor to the Israel Festival in its 36-year history, both for the 1997 and 1998 seasons. \r\n\r\nMr. Levi has made more than twenty recordings with the Atlanta Symphony for Telarc International, devoted to music by Barber, Brahms, Copland, Hindemith, Mendelssohn, Mussorgsky, Prokofiev, Ravel, Rossini, Saint-Saens, Schoenberg, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. His performance of Barber''s works was rated "Barber at his best" by disCDigest. Praising the excitement of his performance of Stravinsky''s Rite of Spring, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote, "Levi revels in the score''s earthy qualities, pushing rhythms and dynamics to their limits." Gramophone magazine hailed the "raw, fiery excitement" of his interpretation of tone poems by Sibelius, while Diapason magazine wrote, "Yoel Levi has taken his place amongst the most eminent conductors of Sibelius." \r\n\r\nOf the Rossini overtures, London''s CD Review raved, "Now one of America''s greatest orchestras, [the ASO] embodies prodigious virtuosity, glowing warmth and stunningly precise ensemble." His most recent releases are a highly regarded performance of Mahler''s Fifth Symphony, and discs devoted to Kodaly (Hary Janos Suite, Dances of Galanta, Peacock Variations) and Barber (Violin Concerto, Piano Concerto, Souvenirs). Awaiting release are discs of Beethoven (Overtures), Holst (The Planets), and Mahler (Symphony No. 6). \r\n\r\nIn May of 1997, Mr. Levi was awarded the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree by Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, and also gave the commencement address. He has also been appointed Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Georgia School of Music, where he will help develop the school''s conducting program, coach chamber ensembles, teach master classes in conducting, present lectures and work with major ensembles. \r\n\r\nThough born in Romania, Mr. Levi grew up in Israel. He studied at the Tel Aviv Academy of Music, where he received a Master of Arts degree with distinction, and at the Jerusalem Academy of Music under Mendi Rodan. He also studied with Franco Ferrara in Sienna and Rome, with Kiril Kondrashin in Holland, and at the Guildhall School of Music in London. He received First Prize in the 1978 Conductors'' International Competition in Besancon, France, and became an assistant to Lorin Maazel at the Cleveland Orchestra for six years, serving as Resident Conductor from 1980 to 1984. He had already established his globe-spanning career as a guest conductor when he became Music Director of the Atlanta Symphony in 1988. He and his family reside in Atlanta, where they are active in the city''s cultural life. \r\n\r\n |  \r\n\r\n-*------------------\r\nBiography\r\n  \r\nLars Johann Yngwie Lannerback was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on the last day of June, 1963. That same year, the Beatles had just emerged from Liverpool, England, soon to make their mark on music history. But it would be another twenty years before a lanky, tousel-haired Swede with hungry eyes would stand the music world on its head once again. The intervening years before the day in February 1983 when Yngwie J. Malmsteen stepped off the plane in Los Angeles provided an environment ripe for the development of a musical prodigy.\r\n\r\nThe marriage between Yngwie''s army captain father and artistic free spirit mother ended in divorce not long after Yngwie was born. The youngest child in a permissive household that included his mother Rigmor, sister Ann Louise, and brother Bjorn, Yngwie (named, his mother claimed, for an old boyfriend) was wild and unruly, and delighted in "anything that had a lot of violence in it." Music, especially guitar playing, was reserved for wimps, and young Yngwie would have none of it. Early attempts at piano and trumpet lessons failed to take hold, and the acoustic guitar his mother bought him at age 5 hung untouched on the wall. It wasn''t until September 18, 1970, when Yngwie saw a TV special on the death of guitar iconoclast Jimi Hendrix, that a flame ignited in his mind. Seven-year-old Yngwie watched with awe as Hendrix blasted the audience with torrents of feedback and sacrificed his guitar in flames. The day Jimi Hendrix died, the guitar-playing Yngwie was born.\r\n\r\nApplying his intense curiosity and tenacity to first an old Mosrite and then a cheap Stratocaster, Yngwie immersed himself in the music of such bands as Deep Purple and spent long hours unlocking the secrets of both the instrument and the music. His admiration for Ritchie Blackmore''s classically influenced playing led him, through his sister''s direction, back to the source: Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven, and Mozart. As Yngwie absorbed the classical structures of the masters, his prodigious style began to take shape. He continued playing for hours each day, often falling asleep draped over his guitar.\r\n\r\nBy age 10, he had taken his mother''s maiden name of Malmsteen, focused all his energies into music, and largely stopped going to school. At school he was often branded a trouble-maker, getting into frequent fights with people "who behaved stupidly," and excelling in the two classes that interested him, English and Art. His mother, who recognized his unique musical gifts, allowed him to stay home with his records and his guitar, where his mastery of the instrument progressed unobstructed. The missing link, however, between the formal structures of classical music and the flamboyant performance of Hendrix was supplied by the music of another virtuoso, 19th century violinist Nicolo Paganini. Watching Russian violinist Gideon Kremer perform Paganini''s 24 Caprices on television, Yngwie understood at last how to marry his love of classical music with his burgeoning guitar skills and onstage charisma.\r\n\r\nBy age 15, pulling off such antics as riding his motorbike through the school hallway, it was clear that school had no place for him, and he left for good. He worked for a time as a luthier in a guitar repair shop, putting his woodworking skills to good use. It was here that he encountered a scalloped neck for the first time when a 17th century lute came into the shop. The wood of the neck was carved out so that the peaks formed the frets. Intrigued, Yngwie scalloped the neck of an old guitar in similar fashion and was impressed enough with the results to try it on his better guitars. The scalloped fretboard was somewhat more difficult to play than a normal neck, but his control over the strings was so improved that Yngwie immediately adopted it as a permanent alteration to his equipment.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Malmsteen began playing in a number of bands built around his explosive guitar style, with long instrumental explorations that tried both the ears and the patience of a Swedish listening public more used to the pop anthems of ABBA. When he turned 18, the army tried to recruit him as officer material, based on his high intelligence test scores. Appearing possessed as only Yngwie can do, he held a gun to his temple and vowed he''d rather die than serve in the military. Convinced, the recruiters sent him packing. Yngwie returned to his music in earnest. In an early incarnation of Rising Force, Yngwie and several friends recorded a demo set of three songs for Swedish CBS, but the cuts were never released. Frustrated, Yngwie knew he would have to leave Sweden to get anywhere, and he began sending demo tapes to record companies and music contacts abroad. One such tape found its way into the hands of Guitar Player contributor and Shrapnel Music founder Mike Varney. Yngwie was invited to Los Angeles to join Shrapnel''s new band Steeler--and the rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nBuilt around Ron Keel, Steeler''s debut album proved to be a typical heavy metal grinder memorable mainly for Yngwie''s now-legendary unaccompanied solo intro to "Hot On Your Heels." By the time the album became a cult favorite, Yngwie had already moved on to Alcatrazz, a Rainbow-style band founded by singer Graham Bonnett. Although Alcatrazz produced some of Yngwie''s most incendiary solo flights, including "Kree Nakoorie," "Jet to Jet," and "Hiroshima, Mon Amour," it also proved to be too limiting, and the only clear course was to go solo.\r\n\r\nYngwie''s first solo album, Rising Force (now considered the bible for neoclassical rock) made it to #60 on the Billboard charts, an impressive feat for a mostly instrumental guitar album with no commercial airplay. The album also gained Yngwie a Grammy nomination for best rock instrumental performance. Soon the honors came rolling in: He was voted Best New Talent in several reader''s polls, Best Rock Guitarist the year after, and Rising Force became Album of the Year. Powered by the jaw-dropping guitar/ keyboard duals of Yngwie and longtime friend Jens Johansson, the band Rising Force blazed a trail on the concert circuit that established Yngwie as one of rock guitar''s brightest new stars and added a new genre to the music lexicon: neoclassical rock.\r\n\r\nYngwie''s neo-classical compositions reached new heights in the 1986 album Trilogy. To this day, it remains one of his favorites, both in lyrical content and musical performance. At this point, Yngwie''s influence on guitar technique and composition was undeniable, although hoards of clones and Malmsteen wannabes tried to copy his style without understanding his unique musical vision. Lacking Yngwie''s musicality, the clones merely sounded like proficient typists, ultimately casting a negative light on the neoclassical approach.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, on June 22, 1987, just shy of his 24th birthday, Yngwie wrapped his Jaguar around a tree, breaking the steering wheel with his head. The resulting concussion caused a blood clot in his brain that damaged the nerves running to his right hand. After lying unconscious in a coma for nearly a week, Yngwie pulled through, only to find his picking hand totally useless. Afraid that his career might be over, he painfully began therapy to bring the hand back to life, impatiently waiting for the damaged nerves to regenerate. Not long out of danger himself, he learned that his mother, the main inspiration of his life, had died in Sweden of cancer. To further complicate things, a duplicitous manager had squandered Yngwie''s earnings, leaving him virtually penniless in the face of mounting medical bills. Rather than completely giving up as many people would have done, Yngwie pulled himself together and turned once again to music for his salvation.\r\n\r\nThe result was Odyssey, not one of Yngwie''s favorites, but highly acclaimed for its accessibility and broader audience appeal. The hit single and video, "Heaven Tonight," gave Yngwie his first taste of heavy rotation airplay and pushed album sales just short of gold status in the U.S. With ex-Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner as frontman, the Odyssey tour brought Yngwie in contact with a new audience not made up exclusively of aspiring guitarists. By February 1989, the show rolled into the Soviet Union for a groundbreaking series of sold-out concerts in both Moscow and Leningrad (pre-ceding Bon Jovi''s Moscow Peace Festival by nearly six months). After the final performance, which resulted in the gold-selling home video Live in Leningrad / Trial By Fire, the band members went their separate ways and the name Rising Force was retired for good.\r\n\r\nBeginning a new phase of his career, Yngwie moved to Miami, Florida, and recruited a new band consisting of fellow Swedes. Anchoring the lead vocalist slot was ex-John Norum singer Goran Edman, whose versatile tenor adapted easily to Yngwie''s demanding melodies. Other positions were filled with musicians who were not well known outside Sweden but whose musical talents were exceptional: symphony orchestra bassist Svante Henryson, experienced studio keyboardist and arranger Mats Olausson, and drummer Michael von Knorring. The new lineup''s first album, Eclipse, recorded and mixed at Miami''s Criteria Studios, proved that Yngwie could write radio-ready accessible material without sacrificing his classical style. Poor promotion by troubled record company Polygram stunted sales in the U.S., but gold and platinum status in Japan and Europe vindicated Yngwie''s decision to leave Rising Force behind.\r\n\r\nIn mounting frustration, Yngwie made the decision to leave Polygram in what was to be a less than amicable parting. As Yngwie has often said, his life always seems to be "fire and ice, either really good or really bad with no in-between." Once the negative situation with Polygram had been eliminated, things began to look up. New manager Nigel Thomas was hard at work on Yngwie''s behalf, and by March of 1991 Yngwie had signed with Elektra Records. \r\n\r\nYngwie''s debut for Elektra, Fire & Ice, reached back to the noncommercial perfection of his best compositions. The album burned with his personal emotions while showcasing the classical structures of the Baroque composers who are his heros. With this album, Yngwie was finally able to accomplish a lifelong desire to record with an orchestra, which appears in his arrangement of Bach''s "Badinerie" from Orchestral Suite No. 2 and in the solo break for "Cry No More." Critically acclaimed for composition and performance, Fire & Ice debuted in Japan at #1 ("Ichi-ban") and sold over 100,000 copies on the day of its release. The album reached gold and platinum status across Europe and Asia. By June 1992, Yngwie returned to Miami to rest and eventually begin work on new compositions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, development of the new album was hampered by a devastating series of events. Hurricane Andrew flattened much of Miami in August 1992, then Nigel Thomas, Yngwie''s manager for 4 years, died of a heart attack in January, 1993, and in March Yngwie learned that Elektra had dropped him from their roster. In July, 1993, Yngwie broke his right hand in a freak accident, and in August he was the victim of a false arrest which made international news.\r\n\r\nIn September, all charges against Yngwie were dropped, and by October his hand had healed completely. A contract was signed with Japan''s Pony Canyon label, and serious recording got underway with new singer Michael Vescera (ex-Loudness), drummer Mike Terrana (ex-Tony McAlpine), keyboardist Mats Olausson, and Yngwie on bass. Barry Sparks from L.A. was later chosen as the tour bassist.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 3 the new band lineup began rehearsals for the upcoming world tour. The new album, The Seventh Sign, was released in Japan on Feb. 18, 1994. The raw, aggressive power of the album brought immediate comparison to one of his earliest works, Marching Out. It quickly reached #1 on the International charts and was certified triple platinum in Japan. CMC International Records picked up the distribution rights for Europe and America, and worked vigorously to promote the new album worldwide. Yngwie''s 7th Sign tour played to sold out audiences in Japan, followed by club appearances in Europe and the U.S. New label CMC worked vigorously to rebuild Yngwie''s core audience and get the new album played on the airwaves. Although the U.S. still proved to be a difficult market due to the current popularity of "grunge" music, The Seventh Sign outsold all other Yngwie albums in Japan and Asia.\r\n\r\nIn September and October, Pony Canyon released two mini-albums, Power and Glory (with Yngwie''s theme for Japanese wrestling champion Takada) and I Can''t Wait (with two previously unreleased tracks and several live tracks from Yngwie''s concert at Tokyo''s Budokan). A Japanese version of the Budokan show was released as a concert video, with worldwide distribution to be handled through CMC. After nearly a year on the road, Yngwie ended the tour in November 1994, and the band went home for a much needed break.\r\n\r\nIn December 1994, construction began on Yngwie''s own recording studio in Miami, with state-of-the-art mixing board, tape drives, and monitoring equipment. Work also began on Yngwie''s next album, Magnum Opus, with a target release date of June, 1995, from Pony Canyon. Yngwie and his manager agreed to part ways with CMC due to lack of distribution capability, and negotiations for a new European/USA label deal began as soon as the master tapes were shipped to Pony Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Magnum Opus tour got underway in September 1995 in Japan, covering an unprecedented 17 cities and drawing his largest crowds ever. From there, the band headed to England and Europe for two months. Midway through the tour, Michael Vescera developed bronchitis from a cold and had to drop out of the tour for 5 shows. The concerts went on as scheduled, however, with Yngwie himself stepping into the singer''s role, although songs that were not in his range had to be eliminated from the playlist. Mike rejoined the band in Germany, taking part in a festival minitour with 4 other bands, including metal veterans Saxon. At year''s end, Yngwie and the band flew home to the U.S. on Christmas Eve, for a well-deserved rest.\r\n\r\nBeginning in January, Yngwie put his Studio 308 to good use, flying in several old friends and musicians-- including Joe Lynn Turner, Jeff Scott Soto, David Rosenthal, Marcel Jacob, and Mark Boals--to work on a new project. For many years, Yngwie kept in the back of his mind the desire to record some of the songs he grew up with that influenced both the way he plays and the way he writes songs. Of course, that meant the music of Deep Purple, Rainbow, U.K., Kansas, Scorpions, Rush, and Jimi Hendrix. With old pals the Johansson brothers providing drum tracks and some of the keyboards, the "Inspiration" album began to take shape. By mid-April, the tapes were mastered and cover artwork was commissioned: a painting by Japanese artist Asari Yoda, featuring visual elements representing the bands covered on the album. With the Magnum Opus lineup disbanded and most of those players moving on to other projects, Yngwie assembled a touring band that proved to be as tight and powerful as any he''s worked with: Mats Olausson continuing to anchor the keyboards slot, Live in Leningrad veteran Barry Dunaway on bass, Trilogy vocalist Mark Boals, and drummer extraordinaire Tommy Aldridge of such bands as Ozzy, Whitesnake, and Pat Travers. South America was the first site of attack for the new lineup, with crowds of delirious Brazilians and Agentinians packing the large concert halls each night. The tour continued unabated into the U.S., Japan, and Europe, proving that Yngwie''s turbo-charged brand of melodic hard rock was not only NOT dead, it had found new life. \r\n\r\nYngwie concluded the "Inspiration" tour in December ''96 with nearly a dozen guitar clinics held in England and Europe. Fan response to these intimate sessions with their hero was so positive that Yngwie promised to try to do more such appearances in the future. After a brief stay in England, hanging out with long-time friend Uli Jon Roth, Yngwie returned home to Miami to begin work on his next studio album as well as his much-anticipated work for electric guitar and orchestra.\r\n\r\nAfter months of intensive work sequestered in his Miami Studio 308, Yngwie produced his first completely classical work, Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in Eb minor, Op. 1. In June of 1997, Yngwie flew to Prague for a date with the prestigious Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, which had recently celebrated the 100th year since its founding. In three intensive days of recording, with Atlanta Symphony conductor Yoel Levi wielding the baton, Yngwie''s dream to record a work of his own with a full symphony orchestra had become reality. Anxious fans would have to wait until 1998 to hear the astonishing results, but they didn''t mind... many of them had been waiting for this since Yngwie''s debut album in 1984!\r\n\r\nNot one to rest on his triumphs, Yngwie returned to Miami to put the finishing touches on his latest studio album, "Facing the Animal," featuring none other than Cozy Powell behind the drums. Fueled with passion and a dark brooding intensity, "Facing the Animal" stakes its claim as one of the Maestro''s strongest offerings yet. \r\n\r\nBiography will be updated at the end of 1998.', '1998-06-30 00:00:00', 0, 1, 9, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-02-25 03:30:57', '2015-02-16 15:47:11', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

(1741, 10672, 'The Haunted', 'The Haunted''s fourth studio album was their first for renowned metal label Century Media, and one has to wonder if the Swedish neo-thrash favorites felt they had something to prove to their new record company. Picking up the slack from 2003''s typically energetic but somewhat tired-sounding One Kill Wonder opus (recorded soon after one of the Björler brothers threatened to derail the band''s progress by going temporarily AWOL), rEVOLVEr brings back that elusive element called "songwriting" (remember that?), so crucial to keeping speed-laden records from concluding on a disappointing "what just happened?" note. No such fears here, since the "EVOLVE" purposefully inserted into rEVOLVEr''s title is immediately evident in new offerings "Abysmal" (unnaturally melodic and ultra-creepy), "Burnt to a Shell" (prowling with desperate intensity), and "My Shadow" (a bonus track that''s simply deeply disturbing). More importantly, even when the Haunted don''t deviate from the norm, there''s still a palpable sense of renewed conviction and desire driving these scalding hot tracks. At their most familiar, frenetic album highlights such as "No Compromise," "Sabotage," and "Sweet Relief" bring modern sonic sensibilities to tried-and-tested old-school thrash techniques derived directly from Slayer, then drill them right through your skull with incredible, nearly vertigo-inducing ferocity. Conversely, though slower cuts like "All Against All," "Nothing Right," and "Liquid Burns" (which explodes into a speed-fest after a deliberate intro) never quite attain escape velocity, their grueling inexorability feels just as devastating at times. Through it all, the Björler brothers'' roots in the awesome At the Gates can still be felt, lingering in the foundation but never overpowering the Haunted''s distinctly violent sound. Likewise, returning original vocalist Peter Dolving brings greater versatility and an urgently barking, hardcore vocal style to the proceedings. His impassioned approach and memorable (even anthemic) choruses -- although perhaps never quite as teetotal, frothing-at-the-mouth loony as At the Gates'' legendary Thomas Lindberg -- are certainly better suited to spearhead the Haunted''s bracing, full-impact assault tactics. These are also expertly adorned by the virtuoso displays put in by lead guitarist Patrik Jensen and Danish drummer extraordinaire Per M. Jensen, making for an album that, despite taking this many chances, should appease both old and new fans alike, if given time to sink in.', '2004-10-18 00:00:00', 0, 1, 9, '', '', 0, '', 1, 0, '2009-03-04 12:38:59', '2015-02-16 15:47:12', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');
